  abstract = {Recently, much attention has been paid to use circulating microRNAs (miRs) as a non-invasive tumor marker. The present study for the first time was designed to evaluate concurrent use of miR-21, miR-638, miR148 and miR-152 as putative diagnostic tool for detection of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).Forty-three patients diagnosed as primary NSCLC was included in this study. The level of selected miRs was measured in whole blood specimens of patients and controls. The corresponding values were also obtained in stages I\textendash IV. We also assessed possible correlation between selected miRs and the clinicopathological findings of studied individuals.miR-21 was increased in patients compared to controls (P\,=\,0.004). In contrast, circulating miR-638, miR-148 and miR-152 was observed to be down-regulated in NSCLC patients than controls (P\,=\,0.001, 0.003, 0.053, respectively). Rise in miR-21-5p expression and decreased blood level of miR-148a-3p was associated with higher stage of NSCLC. The highest sensitivity (90\%) was observed for miR-21 while miR-148 had the highest specificity (71\%). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity for combined-miRs-panel was 96.4\% and 86.67\%, respectively.In summary, our data suggested the diagnostic importance of combined-miR-panel including miR-21, miR-638, miR148 and miR-152 for effective discrimination of NSCLC from non-cancerous subjects.},

Norwegian children start school the year they turn six, making children born in December youngest in their grade. We used data on medication, specialist healthcare diagnoses, and primary healthcare diagnoses from national registers to investigate associations between birth month and ADHD. Methods: All children born in Norway between 1998 and 2006 (N=509,827) were followed from age six until 31 December 2014. We estimated hazard ratios for ADHD medication and diagnoses by birth month in Cox proportional-hazards models. We compared risk among siblings to control for potentially confounding socioeconomic factors, and assessed risk of receiving ADHD medication by birth month while attending different grades in cross-sectional time-series analyses. Results: At end of follow-up, 5.3\% of boys born in October\textendash December had received ADHD medication, compared with 3.7\% of boys born in January\textendash March. Corresponding numbers for girls were 2.2\% and 1.3\%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for ADHD medication for children born in October\textendash December (reference: January\textendash March) was 1.4 (95\% confidence interval: 1.4\textendash 1.5) for boys and 1.8 (1.7\textendash 2.0) for girls. Analyses with diagnoses as outcome showed consistent results, and analyses restricted to siblings within the study population also supported the findings. Analysis by grade revealed an increased risk for children born late in the year from grade 3 onwards, with most marked differences in higher grades. Conclusions: Children youngest in grade had the highest risk of receiving ADHD treatment. Differences were most marked among older children.},

  abstract = {Background ADHD is diagnosed and treated more often in males than in females. Research on gender differences suggests that girls may be consistently underidentified and underdiagnosed because of differences in the expression of the disorder among boys and girls. One aim of the present study was to assess in a clinical sample of medication na\"ive boys and girls with ADHD, whether there were significant gender x diagnosis interactions in co-existing symptom severity and executive function (EF) impairment. The second aim was to delineate specific symptom ratings and measures of EF that were most important in distinguishing ADHD from healthy controls (HC) of the same gender. Methods Thirty-seven females with ADHD, 43 males with ADHD, 18 HC females and 32 HC males between 8 and 17~years were included. Co-existing symptoms were assessed with self-report scales and parent ratings. EF was assessed with parent ratings of executive skills in everyday situations (BRIEF), and neuropsychological tests. The three measurement domains (co-existing symptoms, BRIEF, neuropsychological EF tests) were investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and random forest classification. Results ANOVAs revealed only one significant diagnosis x gender interaction, with higher rates of self-reported anxiety symptoms in females with ADHD. Random forest classification indicated that co-existing symptom ratings was substantially better in distinguishing subjects with ADHD from HC in females (93\% accuracy) than in males (86\% accuracy). The most important distinguishing variable was self-reported anxiety in females, and parent ratings of rule breaking in males. Parent ratings of EF skills were better in distinguishing subjects with ADHD from HC in males (96\% accuracy) than in females (92\% accuracy). Neuropsychological EF tests had only a modest ability to categorize subjects as ADHD or HC in males (73\% accuracy) and females (79\% accuracy). Conclusions Our findings emphasize the combination of self-report and parent rating scales for the identification of different comorbid symptom expression in boys and girls already diagnosed with ADHD. Self-report scales may increase awareness of internalizing problems particularly salient in females with ADHD.},

Results                For all scales combined, the pooled PPVs were: suicide 5.5\% (95\% CI 3.9\textendash 7.9\%), self-harm 26.3\% (95\% CI 21.8\textendash 31.3\%) and self-harm plus suicide 35.9\% (95\% CI 25.8\textendash 47.4\%). Subanalyses on self-harm found pooled PPVs of 16.1\% (95\% CI 11.3\textendash 22.3\%) for high-quality studies, 32.5\% (95\% CI 26.1\textendash 39.6\%) for hospital-treated self-harm and 26.8\% (95\% CI 19.5\textendash 35.6\%) for psychiatric in-patients.

This article provides (a) a methodological critique of studies on race bias and gender bias in diagnosis and (b) a narrative review of results from studies with good internal validity. The results suggest that race bias occurs for the diagnosis of conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, comorbid substance abuse and mood disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic affective disorders. Other results suggest that gender bias occurs for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial and histrionic personality disorders. The way that symptoms are expressed (e.g., Black cultural expressions of depression) appears to have a significant effect on diagnoses. It may be possible to decrease bias by expanding the use of (a) mental health screening, (b) self-report measures including some psychological tests, (c) structured interviews, and (d) statistical prediction rules. Finally, evidence exists that (a) the diagnosis of personality disorders should be made using dimensional ratings and (b) training in cultural diversity and debiasing strategies should be provided to mental health professionals.},

The model displayed a sensitivity of 99\% and specificity of 99\% in the validation set (1358 patients and 1970 non-cancer participants) and exhibited high sensitivity regardless of histological type and pathological TNM stage of the cancer. Moreover, the diagnostic index markedly decreased after lung cancer resection. Thus, the model we developed has the potential to markedly improve screening for resectable lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. It can be difficult to discern the symptoms of PTSD and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities focus on different aspects, which may provide complementary information for PTSD discrimination. However, none of the published studies assessed the diagnostic potential of multimodal MRI in identifying individuals with and without PTSD. In the current study, we investigated whether the complementary information conveyed by multimodal MRI scans could be combined to improve PTSD classification performance. Structural and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans were conducted on 17 PTSD patients, 20 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (TEC) and 20 non-traumatized healthy controls (HC). Gray matter volume (GMV), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and regional homogeneity were extracted as classification features, and in order to integrate the information of structural and functional MRI data, the extracted features were combined by a multi-kernel combination strategy. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to distinguish the subjects at individual level. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. In the pairwise comparison of PTSD, TEC, and HC groups, classification accuracies obtained by the proposed approach were 2.70, 2.50, and 2.71\% higher than the best single feature way, with the accuracies of 89.19, 90.00, and 67.57\% for PTSD vs. HC, TEC vs. HC, and PTSD vs. TEC respectively. The proposed approach could improve PTSD identification at individual level. Additionally, it provides preliminary support to develop the multimodal MRI method as a clinical diagnostic aid.},

Critical issues remain the frequency of unnecessary treatments and impact on mortality, indicating the need for biomarkers of aggressive disease. We explored microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of lung tumors, normal lung tissues and plasma samples from cases with variable prognosis identified in a completed spiral-CT screening trial with extensive follow-up. miRNA expression patterns significantly distinguished: (i) tumors from normal lung tissues, (ii) tumor histology and growth rate, (iii) clinical outcome, and (iv) year of lung cancer CT detection. Interestingly, miRNA profiles in normal lung tissues also displayed remarkable associations with clinical features, suggesting the influence of a permissive microenvironment for tumor development. miRNA expression analyses in plasma samples collected 1\textendash 2 y before the onset of disease, at the time of CT detection and in disease-free smokers enrolled in the screening trial, resulted in the generation of miRNA signatures with strong predictive, diagnostic, and prognostic potential (area under the ROC curve {$\geq$} 0.85). These signatures were validated in an independent cohort from a second randomized spiral-CT trial. These results indicate a role for miRNAs in lung tissues and plasma as molecular predictors of lung cancer development and aggressiveness and have theoretical and clinical implication for lung cancer management.},

The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85\% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92\% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary \textendash{} the replication was either a success or a failure \textendash{} and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80\% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46\% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.},

The success of these programs depends on the validity of published findings. This validity, represented by the reproducibility of published findings, has come into question recently as investigators from companies have raised the issue of poor reproducibility of published results from academic laboratories. Furthermore, retraction rates in high impact journals are climbing. Methods and Findings To examine a microcosm of the academic experience with data reproducibility, we surveyed the faculty and trainees at MD Anderson Cancer Center using an anonymous computerized questionnaire; we sought to ascertain the frequency and potential causes of non-reproducible data. We found that {$\sim$}50\% of respondents had experienced at least one episode of the inability to reproduce published data; many who pursued this issue with the original authors were never able to identify the reason for the lack of reproducibility; some were even met with a less than ``collegial'' interaction. Conclusions These results suggest that the problem of data reproducibility is real. Biomedical science needs to establish processes to decrease the problem and adjudicate discrepancies in findings when they are discovered.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. It is broadly divided into small cell (SCLC, approx. 15\% cases) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, approx. 85\% cases). The main histological subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, with the presence of specific DNA mutations allowing further molecular stratification. If identified at an early stage, surgical resection of NSCLC offers a favourable prognosis, with published case series reporting 5-year survival rates of up to 70\% for small, localized tumours (stage I). However, most patients (approx. 75\%) have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (stage III/IV) and despite significant developments in the oncological management of late stage lung cancer over recent years, survival remains poor. In 2014, the UK Office for National Statistics reported that patients diagnosed with distant metastatic disease (stage IV) had a 1-year survival rate of just 15\textendash 19\% compared with 81\textendash 85\% for stage I.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) processed by exosomes can be detected by liquid biopsy. To objectively evaluate the discriminative ability of miRNAs from whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma, we analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma of 10 lung adenocarcinoma and 9 granuloma patients. With Monte-Carlo feature selection method, the top discriminative miRNAs in whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma were identified, and they were quite different. Using the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) method, we learned the classification rules: in whole plasma, granuloma patients did not express hsa-miR-223-3p while the lung adenocarcinoma patients expressed hsa-miR-223-3p; in EV, the hsa-miR-23b-3p was highly expressed in granuloma patients but not lung adenocarcinoma patients; in EV-free plasma, hsa-miR-376a-3p was expressed in granuloma patients but barely expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients. For prediction performance, whole plasma had the highest weighted accuracy and EV outperformed EV-free plasma. Our results suggested that EV can be used as lung cancer biomarker. However, since it is less stable and not easy to detect, there are still technological difficulties to overcome.},

  abstract = {Background: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and it shows a high incidence worldwide. Circulating microRNAs have been proposed as diagnostic indicators of lung cancer, but inconsistent results in the literature have prevented their widespread use in diagnosis. The present meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of circulating microRNAs for lung cancer. Methods: Several research databases were searched systematically for studies of the accuracy of circulating microRNAs as diagnostic indicators of lung cancer. Results from different studies were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were used to assess the overall performance of microRNA-based assays. Results: Thirteen publications were included in the meta-analysis. The following summary estimates were obtained for the performance of circulating microRNAs in lung cancer diagnosis: sensitivity, 0.85 (95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.83\textendash 0.87); specificity, 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.81\textendash 0.86); positive likelihood ratio, 5.23 (95\% CI: 3.75\textendash 7.29); negative likelihood ratio, 0.20 (95\% CI: 0.14\textendash 0.27); and diagnostic odds ratio, 31.77 (95\% CI: 16.98\textendash 59.42). The SROC curve indicated a maximum joint sensitivity and specificity of 0.85, with an area under the curve of 0.92. Conclusion: Circulating microRNAs show significant potential as diagnostic markers of lung cancer. The results of this meta-analysis justify larger, more rigorous studies to confirm such a diagnostic role.},

MiRwalk tool and enrichment pathway analyses selected some miRNAs whose target genes are correlated with the main pathways involved in NSCLC tumorigenesis. The altered expression of the selected miR-486-5p (a), miR-29c* (b), and miR-133a (c) was confirmed in the validation set (n\,=\,40). MiR-486-5p had a higher expression in tumor serum than in tumor tissues (P\,=\,0.004), and miR-29c* showed a lower expression in tumor tissues than in tumor serum (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). MiR-133a had a not different expression in both tumor serum and tumor tissues (P\,=\,0.07). The low level of miR-486-5p expression in the serum of affected patients was associated with a worse time to progression of disease (P\,=\,0.010), and serum level of miR-486-5p was a significant prognostic indicator of NSCLC (adjusted hazard ratio\,=\,0.179, P\,=\,0.019).

  abstract = {BackgroundNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85\% of lung cancers. This study aimed to discover the potential miRNA biomarkers for early detection of NSCLC.MethodsTotal circulating miRNAs were extracted from six patients and six volunteers and run on the miRNA chip. The differentially expressed miRNAs acquired by data mining were intersected with chip results, and qRT-PCR were carried out. Then the differentially miRNAs were validated by using a validation cohort (120 participants). ROC curves were established to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the differentially circulating miRNAs. The target genes of the differential miRNAs were identified using the miRTarBase database, and follow-up GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were conducted.ResultsWe identified 577 miRNA which screened according to the criteria (fold change {$>$} 2 and p value {$<$} 0.05). Among them, seven circulating miRNAs passed additional filtering based on data mining. These miRNAs were further validated in the training and validation cohort. miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 were differentially expressed in the patients' serum, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of these miRNAs were 0.789, 0.792, and 0.711, respectively. When using them as a combination to discriminate healthy volunteers from patients, the AUC reached 0.828 (95\% CI, 0.750\textendash 0.905, p = 0.000) with a sensitivity of 86.7\% and specificity of 71.7\%. The follow-up enrichment analysis showed that target genes of three miRNA were associated with tumorigenesis and progression, such as cell cycle and P53 signaling pathway.ConclusionsThe combination of miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 can be utilized to distinguish healthy individuals and early-stage NSCLC patients.ImpactThe combination of miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 might be a promising serum biomarker in patients for the early diagnosis of NSCLC.},

  abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

These vesicles are enriched with small RNA, and they play a role in many physiological processes. In the brain, they are involved in processes including synaptic plasticity, neuronal stress response, cell-to-cell communication and neurogenesis. While exosomes have been implicated previously in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, research regarding their role in mental disorders remains scarce. Given their functional significance in the brain, investigation in this field is warranted. Additionally, because exosomes can cross the blood\textendash brain barrier, they may serve as accessible biomarkers of neural dysfunction. Studying exosomes may provide information towards diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, and specifically those derived from the brain may provide a mechanistic view of the disease phenotype.

  abstract = {Importance: The overall low survival rate of patients with lung cancer calls for improved detection tools to enable better treatment options and improved patient outcomes. Multivariable molecular signatures, such as blood-borne microRNA (miRNA) signatures, may have high rates of sensitivity and specificity but require additional studies with large cohorts and standardized measurements to confirm the generalizability of miRNA signatures. Objective: To investigate the use of blood-borne miRNAs as potential circulating markers for detecting lung cancer in an extended cohort of symptomatic patients and control participants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, cohort study included patients from case-control and cohort studies (TREND and COSYCONET) with 3102 patients being enrolled by convenience sampling between March 3, 2009, and March 19, 2018. For the cohort study TREND, population sampling was performed. Clinical diagnoses were obtained for 3046 patients (606 patients with non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, 593 patients with nontumor lung diseases, 883 patients with diseases not affecting the lung, and 964 unaffected control participants). No samples were removed because of experimental issues. The collected data were analyzed between April 2018 and November 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy using miRNA signatures for detection of lung cancer. Results: A total of 3102 patients with a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (16.2) years were enrolled. Data on the sex of the participants were available for 2856 participants; 1727 (60.5\%) were men. Genome-wide miRNA profiles of blood samples from 3046 individuals were evaluated by machine-learning methods. Three classification scenarios were investigated by splitting the samples equally into training and validation sets. First, a 15-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients diagnosed with lung cancer from all other individuals in the validation set with an accuracy of 91.4\% (95\% CI, 91.0\%-91.9\%), a sensitivity of 82.8\% (95\% CI, 81.5\%-84.1\%), and a specificity of 93.5\% (95\% CI, 93.2\%-93.8\%). Second, a 14-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with nontumor lung diseases in the validation set with an accuracy of 92.5\% (95\% CI, 92.1\%-92.9\%), sensitivity of 96.4\% (95\% CI, 95.9\%-96.9\%), and specificity of 88.6\% (95\% CI, 88.1\%-89.2\%). Third, a 14-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients with early-stage lung cancer from all individuals without lung cancer in the validation set with an accuracy of 95.9\% (95\% CI, 95.7\%-96.2\%), sensitivity of 76.3\% (95\% CI, 74.5\%-78.0\%), and specificity of 97.5\% (95\% CI, 97.2\%-97.7\%). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of the study suggest that the identified patterns of miRNAs may be used as a component of a minimally invasive lung cancer test, complementing imaging, sputum cytology, and biopsy tests.},

  abstract = {Objective. It is important to improve identification accuracy for possible early intervention of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recently, effective connectivity (EC), defined as the directed influence of spatially distant brain regions on each other, has been used to find the dysfunctional organization of brain networks in MDD. However, little is known about the ability of whole-brain resting-state EC features in identification of MDD. Here, we employed EC by whole-brain analysis to perform MDD diagnosis. Approach. In this study, we proposed a high-order EC network capturing high-level relationship among multiple brain regions to discriminate 57 patients with MDD from 60 normal controls (NC). In high-order EC networks and traditional low-order EC networks, we utilized the network properties and connection strength for classification. Meanwhile, the support vector machine (SVM) was employed for model training. Generalization of the results was supported by 10-fold cross-validation. Main results. The classification results showed that the high-order EC network performed better than the low-order EC network in diagnosing MDD, and the integration of these two networks yielded the best classification precision with 95\% accuracy, 98.83\% sensitivity, and 91\% specificity. Furthermore, we found that the abnormal connections of high-order EC in MDD patients involved multiple widely concerned functional subnets, particularly the default mode network and the cerebellar network. Significance. The current study indicates whole-brain EC networks, measured by our high-order method, may be promising biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of MDD, and the complementary between high-order and low-order EC will better guide patients to get early interventions as well as treatments.},

  abstract = {Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that negatively affects many people's lives worldwide. Developing an automated method to find useful diagnostic biomarkers from brain imaging data would help clinicians to detect MDD in its early stages. Depression is known to be a brain connectivity disorder problem. In this paper, we present a brain connectivity-based machine learning (ML) workflow that utilizes similarity/dissimilarity of spatial cubes in brain MRI images as features for depression detection. The proposed workflow provides a unified framework applicable to both structural MRI images and resting-state functional MRI images. Several cube similarity measures have been explored, including Pearson or Spearman correlations, Minimum Distance Covariance, or inverse of Minimum Distance Covariance. Discriminative features from the cube similarity matrix are chosen with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The extracted features are fed into machine learning classifiers to train MDD prediction models. To address the challenge of data imbalance in MDD detection, oversampling is performed to balance the training data. The proposed workflow is evaluated through experiments on three independent public datasets, all imbalanced, of structural MRI and resting-state fMRI images with depression labels. Experimental results show good performance on all three datasets in terms of prediction accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The use of features from both structured MRI and resting state functional MRI is also investigated.},

  abstract = {Objective Depression in bipolar disorder (BipD) requires a therapeutic approach that is from treating unipolar major depressive disorder (UniD), but to date, no reliable methods could separate these two disorders. The aim of this study was to establish the clinical validity and utility of a non-invasive functional MRI-based method to classify BipD from UniD. Method The degree of connectivity (degree centrality or DC) of every small unit (voxel) with every other unit of the brain was estimated in 22 patients with BipD and 22 age, gender, and depressive severity-matched patients with UniD and 22 healthy controls. Pattern classification analysis was carried out using a support-vector machine (SVM) approach. Results Degree centrality pattern from 8-min resting fMRI discriminated BipD from UniD with an accuracy of 86\% and diagnostic odds ratio of 9.6. DC was reduced in the left insula and increased in bilateral precuneus in BipD when compared to UniD. In this sample with a high degree of uncertainty (50\% prior probability), positive predictive value of the DC test was 79\%. Conclusion Degree centrality maps are potential candidate measures to separate bipolar depression from unipolar depression. Test performance reported here requires further pragmatic evaluation in regular clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Neuroinflammation has been connected to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and neurochemical biomarkers of glial pathology could aid the diagnosis and might support patient stratification and monitoring in clinical trials. Our study aimed to determine the utility of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocyte activation, for the differential diagnosis and monitoring of MDD. Employing Simoa technology we measured levels of GFAP in prospectively collected serum samples from 81 age-matched patients with MDD, schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and healthy controls (HC). Highest GFAP levels were determined for MDD. At a cut-off of 130~pg/ml, MDD could be discriminated with 87\% sensitivity from SZ and BP (specificity 70\%) and from HC (specificity 56\%). GFAP levels increased with age (r~=~0.5236, p~=~0.0002) and with MDD severity quantified based on the Montgomery-\AA sberg Depression Rating Scale (r~=~0.4308, p~=~0.0221). Neurofilament light chain serum levels were not different in the diagnostic groups and not associated with GFAP levels (r~=~0.0911, p~=~0.576) pointing to an independence of astrocyte activation on neurodegeneration. Our study provides first evidence that serum GFAP levels could improve the differential diagnosis of MDD and that depression severity could be objectively quantified using serum GFAP levels. Furthermore, serum GFAP might represent a marker to monitor astroglial pathology in the course of MDD.},

  abstract = {Background Given that major depressive disorder (MDD) is both biologically and clinically heterogeneous, a diagnostic system integrating neurobiological markers and clinical characteristics would allow for better diagnostic accuracy and, consequently, treatment efficacy. Objective Our study aimed to evaluate the discriminative and predictive ability of unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal approaches in a total of seven machine learning (ML) models\textemdash clinical, demographic, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), combinations of two unimodal models, as well as a combination of all three\textemdash for MDD. Methods We recruited 65 adults with MDD and 68 matched healthy controls, who provided both sociodemographic and clinical information, and completed the HAM-D questionnaire. They were also subject to fNIRS measurement when participating in the verbal fluency task. Using the nested cross validation procedure, the classification performance of each ML model was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results The multimodal ML model was able to distinguish between depressed patients and healthy controls with the highest balanced accuracy of 87.98~{$\pm~$}8.84\% (AUC~=~0.92; 95\% CI (0.84\textendash 0.99) when compared with the uni- and bi-modal models. Conclusions Our multimodal ML model demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for MDD. This reinforces the biological and clinical heterogeneity of MDD and highlights the potential of this model to improve MDD diagnosis rates. Furthermore, this model is cost-effective and clinically applicable enough to be established as a robust diagnostic system for MDD based on patients' biosignatures.},

A few cognitive models have been proposed for understanding GAD development and maintenance. The aim of this study is to review functional Magnetic Resonance Image (fMRI) studies conducted with GAD patients and evaluate if they support and underpin the theoretical cognitive models proposed for this anxiety disorder. Methods A literature systematic review was undertaken in PubMed and ISI databases with no time limits. Results From the studies included in this review, 10 explored the ``emotional dysregulation model'', showing, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hypofunction and deficient top-down control system during emotion regulation tasks, despite conflicting techniques and results. Only one study explored the ``conditioned fear overgeneralization theory'', other the ``intolerance of uncertainty model'' and two studies were unspecific (worry induction tasks). Between those, there were 4 studies evaluating pre- and post-treatment with antidepressants or ``mindfulness''. Limitations The studies×³ methodologies differ between one another making it difficult to identify a common finding. Conclusion Emotion dysregulation seems to be an important cognitive dysfunction in GAD patients and fMRI studies suggest that it is related to PFC and ACC hypofunction as well as a deficient cortex\textendash amygdala functional connectivity.},

Although new therapies are needed, lack of knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms underlying TRD hinders development of new therapeutic options. We aimed to identify brain regions in which spontaneous neural activity is not only altered in TRD but also associated with early treatment resistance in MDD. Sixteen patients with TRD, 16 patients with early-phase non-TRD and 26 healthy control (HC) subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. To identify brain region differences in spontaneous neural activity between patients with and without TRD, we assessed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF). We also calculated correlations between the percent change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) scores and fALFF values in brain regions with differing activity for patients with and without TRD. Patients with TRD had increased right-thalamic fALFF values compared with patients without TRD. The percent change in HRSD17 scores negatively correlated with fALFF values in patients with non-TRD. In addition, patients with TRD showed increased fALFF values in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and vermis, compared with patients with non-TRD and HC subjects. Our results show that spontaneous activity in the right thalamus correlates with antidepressant treatment response. We also demonstrate that spontaneous activity in the right IFG, IPL and vermis may be specifically implicated in the neural pathophysiology of TRD.},

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {$<$}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent ``boosting'' paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion.Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

LC comprises of two major clinicopathological categories: small-cell (SCLC) and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, usually 18\textendash 25 nucleotides long, which repress protein translation through binding to complementary target mRNAs. The miRNAs regulate many biological processes including cell cycle regulation, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, neuronal patterning, and aging. This review summarizes the role of miRNAs expression in LC. It also provides information about the miRNAs as biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer. Understanding the role of miRNAs in LC may provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment strategy for LC.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify tumor-derived exosomal biomarkers that are able to discriminate between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as a noninvasive method in the early diagnosis of non\textendash small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental Design: Tumor-derived exosomes from the plasma of early-stage NSCLC patients were isolated. Exosomal miRNA profiling of 46 stage I NSCLC patients and 42 healthy individuals was performed using miRNA-seq to identify and validate adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific miRNAs. The diagnostic accuracy of select miRNAs was tested further with an additional 60 individuals. Results: There were 11 and 6 miRNAs expressed at remarkably higher levels, 13 and 8 miRNAs expressed at lower levels in adenocarcinoma and SCC patients, respectively, compared with healthy volunteers. Distinct adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific exosomal miRNAs were validated. The reliability of miRNA-seq data was verified with several demonstrated diagnostic potential miRNAs for NSCLC and other carcinomas, as reported in previous studies, such as let-7, miR-21, miR-24, and miR-486. The results indicated that miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p, and miR-361-5p were adenocarcinoma-specific, and miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were SCC-specific. The diagnostic accuracy of three combination miRNA panels was evaluated using an AUC value of 0.899, 0.936, and 0.911 for detecting NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, and SCC, respectively. Conclusions: Tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs, adenocarcinoma-specific miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p and miR-361-5p, and SCC-specific miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were observed by next-generation sequencing, and their diagnostic accuracy were verified. These miRNAs may be promising and effective candidates in the development of highly sensitive, noninvasive biomarkers for early NSCLC diagnosis.

JSB contains sera from 318,628 originally healthy persons, more than 96,000 of whom developed cancer. We selected 210 serum samples from patients with lung, colon or breast cancer at three time points prior to diagnosis (up to 32 years prior to diagnosis with median 5 years interval between TPs), one time-point after diagnosis and from individually matched controls. The controls were matched on age and year of all pre-diagnostic sampling time-points for the corresponding case.Using ANOVA we report 70 significantly deregulated markers (adjusted p-value{$<$}0.05). The driver for the significance was the diagnostic time point (miR-575, miR-6821-5p, miR-630 with adjusted p-values{$<$}10-10). Further, 91miRNAs were differently expressed in pre-diagnostic samples as compared to controls (nominal p {$<$} 0.05). Self-organized maps (SOMs)indicated larges effects in lung cancer samples while breast cancer samples showed the least pronounced changes. SOMsalsohighlighted cancer and time point specific miRNA dys-regulation. Intriguingly, a detailed breakdown of the results highlighted that 51\% of all miRNAs were highly specific, either for a time-point or a cancer entity. Pathway analysis highlighted 12 pathways including Hipo signalling and ABC transporters.Our results indicate that tumours may be indicated by serum miRNAs decades prior the clinical manifestation.},

Serum EVs were isolated from NSCLC patients (n = 31) and control subjects (n = 21). RNA was isolated from EVs and reverse transcription reaction was performed. Relative levels of miR-23a, miR-361, miR-1228 and miR-let7i were assessed in real-time qPCR using TaqMan probes. Analysis was based on the 2-{$\Delta\Delta$}CT method. Statistically significant lower levels of miR-23a and miR-let7i were observed among NSCLC patients vs. control group: miR-23a, 0.054 vs. 0.107; miR-let7i, 0.193 vs. 0.369 (p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the diagnostic potential of each individual serum EV-derived miRNA with an area under the curve AUC = 0.744 for miR-23a (p = 0.0003), 0.733 for miR-let7i (p = 0.0007). The decreased level of miR-23a in patients correlated with metastasis to lymph nodes and with AJCC tumor staging system. The results demonstrate that miR-23a and miR-let7i may prove clinically useful as significant, non-invasive markers in NSCLC diagnosis. Additionally, changing profile level of miR-23a that correlates with cancer development may be considered as an NSCLC progression marker.},

  pages = {ix, 126 pages},
  abstract = {Grit, the concept consisting of perseverance and passion towards a desired long-term goal, has been spotlighted as a key psychological resource that is predictive of positive life outcomes including academic achievement, professional success and subjective well-being. Despite its popularity within and outside of academia, much more needs to be researched before we can understand its properties and sociological utility. This dissertation explores the potential location of grit within various sociological discourses, including literature on agency, stratification, and perceived meritocracy. In addition, I explore the relationship between social status, subjective agency, the social valuation of grit, and grit cross-culturally to place grit within proper cultural and structural contexts. In Chapter 2, I propose the psychological notion of grit as a potentially useful variable in sociological analysis and explore its potential for contributing to addressing sociological concerns including human agency and stratification. Grit could work as a ``behavioral engine'' transforming subjective beliefs about agency (e.g., sense of control) to agentic practices that potentially produce better life outcomes. In Chapter 3, using new cross-cultural data collected from South Korea and the United States, I test the current measure of grit, the Grit-S scale, that is developed and predominantly tested in the United States, in two different countries, South Korea and the United States. I find in both countries grit is better understood as the concept consisting of two separate dimensions, perseverance and passion, rather than a global concept. In addition, I find the perseverance facet of grit, but not the passion facet, shows the distinctive utility in explaining subjective well-being beyond subjective agency (i.e., sense of control) in both countries. In Chapter 4, I analyze novel cross-cultural data collected from four nations (France, South Korea, Turkey and the United States) and find an indirect linkage between a person's socioeconomic status and the level of grit through positive associations with the sense of control. That is, people with a higher socioeconomic status tend to hold stronger beliefs about one's agency, and those who are strong believers in one's control over life outcomes, in turn, are more likely to develop grit in these four countries. In Chapter 5, using the same cross-cultural data used in Chapter 3, I investigate the social valuation of grit and whether and how the valuation of grit is associated with individual development of grit in South Korea and the United States. In both countries, grit is valued as a desirable virtue that leads to success in life. However, there is within-society variance: people from lower social statuses tend to value grit as a virtue that leads to success more than those from higher statuses in both country samples. In addition, I find people with a higher sense of control are more likely to value grit as a virtue, and valuing grit is positively associated with the individual development of perseverance in both countries.},

  abstract = {Background: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in Eastern Asia. The prognosis of LC highly depends on tumor stages and early detection could substantially reduce LC mortality. Accumulating evidence suggested that circulating miRNAs in plasma or serum may have applications in early LC detection. We thus conducted a systematic literature review on the diagnostic value of miRNAs markers for LC in East Asian populations. Methods: PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to retrieve relevant articles published up to 17 September 2018. Information on study design, population characteristics, investigated miRNAs and diagnostic accuracy (including sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC)) were independently extracted by two reviewers. Results: Overall, 46 studies that evaluated a total of 88 miRNA markers for LC diagnosis in East Asian populations were identified. Sixteen of the 46 studies have incorporated individual miRNA markers as panels (with 2\textendash 20 markers). Three promising miRNA panels with {$\geq$}90\% sensitivity and {$\geq$}90\% specificity were discovered, two of which were externally validated. Diagnostic performance of circulating miRNAs in East Asian populations was comparable to previously summarized performance in Western populations. Forty-four miRNAs were reported in both populations. No major differences in diagnostic performance by ethnicity of the same miRNA was observed. Conclusions: Circulating miRNAs or miRNA panels, possibly in combination with other promising molecular markers including epigenetic and genetic markers, may be promising candidates for noninvasive LC early detection. However, large studies with samples collected prospectively in true screening settings are required to validate the promising markers or marker panels.},

With the present study we wanted to investigate if miRNA blood signatures are also suited to differentiate lung cancer patients from COPD patients. We compared the expression of 863 human miRNAs in blood cells of lung cancer patients, COPD patients, and healthy controls. The miRNA pattern from patients with lung cancer and COPD were more similar to each other than to the healthy controls. However, we were able to discriminate lung cancer patients and COPD patients with 90.4\% accuracy, 89.2\% specificity, and 91.7\% sensitivity. In total, 140 miRNAs were significant for the comparison COPD and controls, 61 miRNAs were significant for the comparison lung cancer and controls, and 14 miRNAs were significant for the comparison lung cancer and COPD. Screening target databases yielded over 400 putative targets for those 14 miRNAs. The predicted mRNA targets of three of the 14 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in PBMCs of lung cancer patients compared to patients with non-malignant lung diseases. In conclusion, we showed that blood miRNA signatures are suitable to distinguish lung cancer from COPD.},

Here we provide longitudinal analysis of 1,205 miRNAs in plasma samples of 26 patients after lung cancer resection at 8 time points over a period of 18 months and compare them to 12 control patients. First, we report longitudinal changes with respect to the number of detected miRNAs over time and identified a significantly increased number of miRNAs in patients developing metastases (p = 0.0096). A quantitative analysis with respect to the expression level of the detected miRNAs revealed more significant changes in the miRNA levels in samples from patients without metastases compared to the non-cancer control patients. This analysis provided further evidence of miRNA plasma levels that are changing over time after tumor resection and correlate to patient outcome. Especially hsa-miR-197 could be validated by qRT-PCR as prognostic marker. Also for this miRNA, patients developing metastases had levels close to that of controls while patients that did not develop metastases showed a significant up-regulation., In conclusion, our data indicate that the overall miRNome of a patient that later develops metastases is less affected by surgery than the miRNome of a patient who does not show metastases. The relationship between altered plasma levels of specific miRNAs with the development of metastases would partially have gone undetected by an analysis at a single time point only.},

We validated this result in an independent set of 35 paired tumors and their adjacent normal tissues, as well as their sera that are collected before surgical resection or chemotherapy, and the results suggested that hsa-miR-96 may play an important role in NSCLC development and has great potential to be used as a noninvasive marker for diagnosing NSCLC. We predicted potential miRNA target mRNAs based on different methods (TargetScan and miRanda). Further classification of miRNA regulated genes based on their relationship with miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-96 and certain other miRNAs tend to down-regulate their target mRNAs in NSCLC development, which have expression levels permissive to direct interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. In addition, we identified a significant correlation of miRNA regulation with genes coincide with high density of CpG islands, which suggests that miRNA may represent a primary regulatory mechanism governing basic cellular functions and cell differentiations, and such mechanism may be complementary to DNA methylation in repressing or activating gene expression.},

Nevertheless, the clinical transferability of such tests is uncertain due to still-insufficient standardization and optimization of methods to detect circulating miRNAs in the clinical setting. METHODS: We performed a series of tests to optimize the quantification of serum miRNAs that compose the miR-Test, a signature for lung cancer early detection, and systematically analyzed variables that could affect the performance of the test. We took advantage of a large-scale ({$>$}1000 samples) validation study of the miR-Test that we recently published, to evaluate, in clinical samples, the effects of analytical and preanalytical variables on the quantification of circulating miRNAs and the clinical output of the signature (risk score). RESULTS: We developed a streamlined and standardized pipeline for the processing of clinical serum samples that allows the isolation and analysis of circulating miRNAs by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, with a throughput compatible with screening trials. The major source of analytical variation came from RNA isolation from serum, which could be corrected by use of external (spike-in) or endogenous miRNAs as a reference for normalization. We also introduced standard operating procedures and QC steps to check for unspecific fluctuations that arise from the lack of standardized criteria in the collection or handling of the samples (preanalytical factors). CONCLUSIONS: We propose our methodology as a reference for the development of clinical-grade blood tests on the basis of miRNA detection.},

  abstract = {Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA molecules that can be detected in bodily fluids without the need for major invasive procedures on patients. miRNAs have shown great promise as biomarkers for tumors to both assess their presence and to predict their type and subtype. Recently, thanks to the availability of miRNAs datasets, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to tumor classification. The results, however, are difficult to assess and interpret by medical experts because the algorithms exploit information from thousands of miRNAs. In this work, we propose a novel technique that aims at reducing the necessary information to the smallest possible set of circulating miRNAs. The dimensionality reduction achieved reflects a very important first step in a potential, clinically actionable, circulating miRNA-based precision medicine pipeline. While it is currently under discussion whether this first step can be taken, we demonstrate here that it is possible to perform classification tasks by exploiting a recursive feature elimination procedure that integrates a heterogeneous ensemble of high-quality, state-of-the-art classifiers on circulating miRNAs. Heterogeneous ensembles can compensate inherent biases of classifiers by using different classification algorithms. Selecting features then further eliminates biases emerging from using data from different studies or batches, yielding more robust and reliable outcomes. The proposed approach is first tested on a tumor classification problem in order to separate 10 different types of cancer, with samples collected over 10 different clinical trials, and later is assessed on a cancer subtype classification task, with the aim to distinguish triple negative breast cancer from other subtypes of breast cancer. Overall, the presented methodology proves to be effective and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs for NSCLC. (2) Methods. Databases and reference lists were searched. Pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and area under the curve (AUC) were applied to examine the general diagnostic efficacy, and subgroup analysis was also performed. (3) Results. Pooled SEN, SPE, and AUC were 85\%, 88\%, and 0.93, respectively, for 71 studies. Multiple miRNAs (AUC: 0.96) obtained higher diagnostic value than single miRNA (AUC: 0.86), and the same result was found for Caucasian population (AUC: 0.97) when compared with Asian (AUC: 0.91) and Caucasian/African population (AUC: 0.92). MiRNA had higher diagnostic efficacy when participants contained both smokers and nonsmokers (AUC is 0.95 for imbalanced group and 0.91 for balanced group) than when containing only smokers (AUC: 0.90). Meanwhile, AUC was 0.91 for both miR-21 and miR-210. (4) Conclusions. Multiple miRNAs such as miR-21 and miR-210 could be used as diagnostic tools for NSCLC, especially for the Caucasian and nonsmoking NSCLC.},

In the past few years, microRNA (miRNA) expression changes in circulating peripheral tissues have been found to be correlative with changes in neuronal tissues from patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. This is a notable quality of a biomolecule to be considered as a biomarker for both prognosis and diagnosis of disease. miRNAs, members of the small non-coding RNA family, have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to epigenetically influence almost every aspect of brain functioning. Empirical evidence suggests that miRNA-associated changes in the brain are often translated into behavioral changes. Current clinical understanding further implicates their role in the management of major psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). This review aims to critically evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in psychiatric disorders as well as in treatment response.},

This requirement is particularly obvious in the nervous system where originally common stem cell populations generate thousands of different neuronal and glial cell types in a temporally and quantitatively perfectly orchestrated manner. Moreover, after their generation, young neurons have to connect with pre-determined target neurons through the establishment of functional synapses, either in their immediate environment or at distance. Lastly, brain function depends not only on static circuitries, but on plastic changes at the synaptic level allowing both, learning and memory. It appears evident that these processes necessitate flexibility and stability at the same time. These two contrasting features can only be achieved by complex molecular networks, superposed levels of control and tight interactions between regulatory mechanisms. Interactions between microRNAs and their target mRNAs fulfill these requirements. Here we review recent literature dealing with the involvement of microRNAs in multiple aspects of brain development and connectivity.},

Based on the criteria of {$\geq$}3 independent studies and a sensitivity and specificity of {$>$}0.8 we found blood-borne miR-20a, miR-10b, miR-150, and miR-223 to be excellent diagnostic biomarkers for non\textendash small cell LC whereas miR-205 is specific for squamous cell carcinoma.

Moreover, theranostic biomarker candidates with proven responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitor treatments were identified, notably miR-34a, miR-93, miR-106b, miR-181a, miR-193a-3p, and miR-375. Conversely, miR-103a-3p, miR-152, miR-152-3p, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-194, miR-34b, and miR-506 influence programmed cell death-ligand 1 and programmed cell death-1 receptor expression, therefore providing a rationale for the development of molecularly targeted therapies.

In recent years, the emergence of small noncoding RNAs as a mega controller of gene expression has gained attention for their role in various disease processes. Among various noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) are the most studied and well characterized and have emerged as a major regulator of neural plasticity and higher brain functioning. More recently, although limited in number, studies are focusing on how miRNAs can play a role in the maladaptive processes associated with ELS both at adolescent and adult age and whether these processes are critical in developing depression and suicidal behavior.

Methods: Samples were obtained from 237 patients with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV criteria) treated with either duloxetine or placebo in an 8-week randomized controlled trial. Data were collected between 2007 and 2011. The relationship between treatment-worsening suicidal ideation (TWSI) and a number of clinical variables, as well as peripheral expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), was assessed at baseline. We generated 4 predictive models for TWSI: clinical, mRNA, miRNA, and a combined model comprising the best predictive variables from clinical, mRNA, and miRNA data. Results: Eleven patients (9.8\%) presented with TWSI in the duloxetine group. Among the clinical variables, only baseline depressive severity was found to be mildly predictive of TWSI. Two mRNAs (stathmin 1 [STMN1] and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9B [PPP1R9B]) and 2 miRNAs (miR-3688 and miR-5695) were identified that were significantly predictive of TWSI when mRNA and miRNA were assessed separately (P = .002, .044, .004, and .005, respectively). The best model included baseline depression severity and expression of STMN1 and miR-5695 and predicted TWSI with area under the curve = 0.94 (P {$<$} .001). Additionally, the combined model did not significantly predict TWSI in the placebo group. Conclusions: This study generated a predictive tool for TWSI that combines both biological and clinical variables. These biological variables can be easily quantified in peripheral tissues, thus rendering them viable targets to be used in both clinical practice and future studies of suicidal behaviors.

In the present study, we assessed microRNA expression in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) of a well-characterized cohort of major depressed, bipolar, and schizophrenia subjects (obtained from Stanley Neuropathology Consortium; n = 15 in each group), using high throughput RT-PCR plates. Discrete miRNA alterations were observed in all disorders, as well as in suicide subjects (pooled across diagnostic categories) compared to all non-suicide subjects. The changes in the schizophrenia group were partially similar to those in the bipolar group, but distinct from changes in depression and suicide. Intriguingly, those miRNAs which were down-regulated in the schizophrenia group tended to be synaptically enriched, whereas up-regulated miRNAs tended not to be. To follow this up, we purified synaptosomes from pooled samples of the schizophrenia vs. control groups and subjected them to Illumina deep sequencing. There was a significant loss of small RNA expression in schizophrenia synaptosomes only for certain sequence lengths within the miRNA range. Moreover, 73 miRNAs were significantly down-regulated whereas only one was up-regulated. Strikingly, across all expressed miRNAs in synaptosomes, there was a significant inverse correlation between the fold-change of a given miRNA seen in schizophrenia and its synaptic enrichment ratio observed in controls. Thus, synaptic miRNAs tended to be down-regulated in schizophrenia, and the more highly synaptically enriched miRNAs tended to show greater down-regulation. These findings point to some deficit in miRNA biogenesis, transport, processing or turnover in schizophrenia that is selective for the synaptic compartment. A novel class of ncRNA-derived small RNAs, shown to be strongly induced during an early phase of learning in mouse, is also expressed in man, and at least one representative (SNORD85) was strongly down-regulated in schizophrenia synaptosomes.},

We aimed to determine the availability of miRNAs as biomarkers in serum and to demonstrate the changes of miRNAs expression in patients with panic disorder (PD).METHODS: Thirty-five patients with PD and 35 healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-I (SCID-I) and Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). In each group miRNA expression analysis was performed in venous blood by the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT\textendash PCR) method for genetic evaluation.RESULTS: Compared with the HC group, eight miRNA expression levels were found different in the PD group. Five of them were upregulated and three of them were downregulated. There was no correlation between the levels of miRNA expression with PDSS total score and PDSS sub-items. However, miR-1297 and miR-4465 expression levels were significantly different between the two groups.LIMITATIONS: There are some limitations in this research. Firstly the number of samples is small. Another limitation of our study is that the presence of medical illness and continuous drug use were not excluded when PD and HC groups were selected.CONCLUSIONS: Our research is the first miRNA expression study in patients with PD which excluded psychotropic use and additional psychiatric disorders. In the PD group, miR-1297 and miR-4465 expression was upregulated than compared to the HC group. miR-1297 and miR-4465 regulate the GABAA gene regions that affect GABAA receptor subtypes that thought to play a role in the aetiology of PD.},

  abstract = {Currently, diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) are based on the patients' description of symptoms, mental status examinations, and clinical behavioral observations, which increases the chance of misdiagnosis. There is a serious need to find a practical biomarker for the proper diagnosis of MDD. This study aimed to explore the possibility of microRNA (miRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as specific blood-based biomarker for MDD patients. By using an Affymetrix array that covers 723 human miRNAs, we identified 26 miRNAs with significant changes in expression in PBMCs of MDD patients. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in a larger cohort of 81 MDD patients and 46 healthy controls confirmed that the expression levels of 5 miRNAs (miRNA-26b, miRNA-1972, miRNA-4485, miRNA-4498, and miRNA-4743) were up-regulated. By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the combining area under the ROC curve (AUC) of these five miRNAs was 0.636 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.58\textendash 0.90]. MiRNA target gene prediction and functional annotation analysis showed that there was a significant enrichment in several pathways associated with nervous system and brain functions, supporting the hypothesis that differentially-regulated miRNAs may be involved in mechanism underlying development of MDD. We conclude that altered expression of miRNAs in PMBCs might be involved in multiple stages of MDD pathogenesis, and thus might be able to serve as specific biomarker for diagnosis of MDD.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of reliable biomarkers for major depressive disorder (MDD) in clinical practice. However, several studies have shown an association between alterations in microRNA levels and MDD, albeit none of them has taken advantage of machine learning (ML).Supervised and unsupervised ML were applied to blood microRNA expression profiles from a MDD case-control dataset (n = 168) to distinguish between (1) case vs control status, (2) MDD severity levels defined based on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and (3) antidepressant responders vs nonresponders.MDD cases were distinguishable from healthy controls with an area-under-the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97 on testing data. High- vs low-severity cases were distinguishable with an AUC of 0.63. Unsupervised clustering of patients, before supervised ML analysis of each cluster for MDD severity, improved the performance of the classifiers (AUC of 0.70 for cluster 1 and 0.76 for cluster 2). Antidepressant responders could not be successfully separated from nonresponders, even after patient stratification by unsupervised clustering. However, permutation testing of the top microRNA, identified by the ML model trained to distinguish responders vs nonresponders in each of the 2 clusters, showed an association with antidepressant response. Each of these microRNA markers was only significant when comparing responders vs nonresponders of the corresponding cluster, but not using the heterogeneous unclustered patient set.Supervised and unsupervised ML analysis of microRNA may lead to robust biomarkers for monitoring clinical evolution and for more timely assessment of treatment in MDD patients.},

This case\textendash control study was designed to develop microRNA (miRNA)-based serum biomarker for depression. Materials and Methods: In this study, 39 patients with depression and 36 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum miRNAs gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis; finally, the data represent as the 2\textendash{$\Delta$}Ct followed by further statistical analysis. Results: The serum level of miR-16 was significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) down-regulated (mean: 0.9123 and standard deviation [SD]: 0.06) in compared to normal individuals (mean: 1.6848 and SD: 0.09). The concentration of miR-135a was also catastrophically decreased (P {$<$} 0.001) in the patients (mean: 1.160 and SD: 0.07) in compared to control (mean: 1.819 and SD: 0.09). The relative miR-1202 expression levels were significantly lower (P {$<$} 0.001) in the patients (mean: 0.1755 and SD: 0.01) than in the healthy individuals (mean: 0.2939 and SD: 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated the obvious separation between patient and healthy control, with an AUC of 0.75 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.642\textendash 0.858, P {$<$} 0.001), 0.72 (95\% CI = 0.607\textendash 0.834, P {$<$} 0.001), and 0.74 (95\% CI = 0.630\textendash 0.861, P {$<$} 0.001) for miR-16, miR-135a, and miR-1202, respectively. The data suggest that these miRNAs have a potential to be used as a biomarker of depression with sensitivity 77.8\% and specificity of 61.5\% for miR-16, 94.4\% and 41.0\% for miR-135a as well as 86.1\% and 61.5\% for miR-1202, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings showed that these miRNA can be used as a biomarker of depression diagnosis. MiR-135a and miR-1202 exhibited better sensitivity and specificity, respectively.},

  abstract = {Major depression is a debilitating disease. To date, the development of biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a challenge. Recently, alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) from post-mortem brain tissue and peripheral blood have been linked to MDD. The goals of this study were to detect the differential miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of MDD patients. First, the relative expression levels of 179 miRNAs (relative high levels in serum) were analyzed by miRNA PCR Panel in the CSF of MDD patients. Then, the differentially altered miRNAs from CSF were further assessed by qRT-PCR in the serum of the same patients. Finally, the serum differentially altered miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR in the serum of another MDD patients. The CSF-results indicated that 11 miRNAs in MDD patients were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 5 miRNAs were significantly lower than these in control subjects. The serum-results from the same patients showed that 3 miRNAs (miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, and let-7d-3p) of the 11 miRNAs were significantly higher than these in control subjects, and 1 miRNA (miR-451a) of 5 miRNAs was significantly lower than these in control subjects. The up-regulation of miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p and down-regulation of miR-451a was further validated in another 32 MDD patients. ROC analysis showed that the area under curve of let-7d-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-221-3p and miR-451a was 0.94, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.94, with specificity of 90.48\%, 95.24\%, 90.48\% and 90.48\%, and sensitivity of 93.75\%, 96.88\%, 90.63\% and 84.85\%, respectively. In addition, target gene prediction found that the altered miRNAs are involved in affecting some important genes and pathway related to MDD. Our results suggested that differentially altered miRNAs in CSF might be involved in MDD, and serum miR-221-3p, miR-34a-5p, let-7d-3p, and miR-451a might be able to serve as biomarkers for MDD.},

However, no study has evaluated miRNA expression in older adults with major depression (or late-life depression [LLD]). Our primary aim was to evaluate the expression of miRNAs in subjects with LLD. We first evaluated the miRNA expression using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and then we validated the miRNAs found in NGS in an independent sample of LLD patients, using RT-qPCR. Drosophila melanogaster model was used to evaluate the impact of changes in miRNA expression on behavior. NGS analysis showed that hsa-miR-184 (log2foldchange\,=\,-4.21, p\,=\,1.2\,\texttimes\,10-03) and hsa-miR-1-3p (log2foldchange\,=\,-3.45, p\,=\,1.3\,\texttimes\,10-02) were significantly downregulated in LLD compared to the control group. RT-qPCR validated the downregulation of hsa-miR-184 (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), but not for the hsa-miR-1-3p. The knockout flies of the ortholog of hsa-miR-184 showed significantly reduced locomotor activity at 21\textendash 24\,d.p.e (p\,=\,0.04) and worse memory retention at 21\textendash 24\,d.p.e (24h post-stimulus, p\,=\,0.02) compared to control flies. Our results demonstrated that subjects with LLD have significant downregulation of hsa-miR-184. Moreover, the knockout of hsa-miR-184 in flies lead to depressive-like behaviors, being more pronounce in older flies.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating psychiatric mood disorder that lacks objective laboratory-based tests to support its diagnosis. A class of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found to be centrally involved in regulating many molecular processes fundamental to central nervous system function. Among these miRNAs, miRNA-134 (miR-134) has been reported to be related to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In this study, the hypothesis that plasma miR-134 can be used to diagnose MDD was tested. Perturbation of peripheral and central miR-134 in a depressive-like rat model was also examined. By reverse-transcription quantitative PCR, miR-134 was comparatively measured in a small set of plasma samples from MDD and healthy control (HC) subjects. To determine its diagnostic efficacy, plasma miR-134 levels were assessed in 100 MDD, 50 bipolar disorder (BD), 50 schizophrenic (SCZ), and 100 HC subjects. A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model was also developed to evaluate miR-134 expression in plasma, hippocampus (HIP), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and olfactory bulb. We found that plasma miR-134 was significantly downregulated in MDD subjects. Diagnostically, plasma miR-134 levels could effectively distinguish MDD from HC with 79\% sensitivity and 84\% specificity, while distinguishing MDD from HC, BD, and SCZ subjects with 79\% sensitivity and 76.5\% specificity. Congruent with these clinical findings, CUMS significantly reduced miR-134 levels in the rat plasma, HIP, and PFC. Although limited by the relatively small sample size, these results demonstrated that plasma miR-134 displays potential ability as a biomarker for MDD.},

MicroRNA (miRNA) fingerprints have been explored for disease diagnosis. We performed a meta-analysis to examine miRNA diagnostic value for SZ and further validated the meta-analysis results. Using following terms: schizophrenia/SZ, microRNA/miRNA, diagnosis, sensitivity and specificity, we searched databases restricted to English language and reviewed all articles published from January 1990 to October 2016. All extracted data were statistically analyzed and the results were further validated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) isolated from patients and healthy controls using RT-qPCR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A total of 6 studies involving 330 patients and 202 healthy controls were included for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.86), 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.72-0.88) and 18 (95\% CI: 9-34), respectively; the positive and negative likelihood ratio was 4.3 and 0.24 respectively; the area under the curve in summary ROC was 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.84-0.90). Validation revealed that miR-181b-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-137, miR-346 and miR-34a-5p in PBMNCs had high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the context of schizophrenia. In conclusion, blood-derived miRNAs might be promising biomarkers for SZ diagnosis.},

Thousands of these molecules have been discovered to date, and multiple miRNAs have been shown to coordinately fine-tune cellular processes key to organismal development, homeostasis, neurobiology, immunobiology, and control of infection. The fundamental regulatory role of miRNAs in a variety of biological processes suggests that differential expression of these transcripts may be exploited as a novel source of molecular biomarkers for many different disease pathologies or abnormalities. This has been emphasized by the recent discovery of remarkably stable miRNAs in mammalian biofluids, which may originate from intracellular processes elsewhere in the body. The potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease has mainly been demonstrated for various types of cancer. More recently, however, attention has focused on the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease; for example, human tuberculosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, sepsis caused by multiple infectious agents, and viral hepatitis. Here, we review these developments and discuss prospects and challenges for translating circulating miRNA into novel diagnostics for infectious disease.},

Proper control of miRNA expression is essential for maintaining a steady state of the cellular machinery. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy and diseased patients, although ribonuclease is present in both plasma and serum. Most of the circulating miRNAs are included in lipid or lipoprotein complexes, such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, or exosomes, and are, therefore, highly stable. The existence of circulating miRNAs in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function, as well as the meaning of the existence of extracellular miRNAs, remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarize the usefulness of circulating miRNA for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the secretion and incorporation of miRNA into the cells.},

The levels of these miRNAs were also reduced in the serum of AD risk factor models.

CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders. Furthermore, it is shown that the type of bodily fluid used for measuring cimiRNAs is important as inconsistencies in cimiRNAs expression directions are found when comparing CSF, blood cell-free and blood cell-bound samples.},

LC comprises of two major clinicopathological categories: small-cell (SCLC) and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, usually 18-25 nucleotides long, which repress protein translation through binding to complementary target mRNAs. The miRNAs regulate many biological processes including cell cycle regulation, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, neuronal patterning, and aging. This review summarizes the role of miRNAs expression in LC. It also provides information about the miRNAs as biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer. Understanding the role of miRNAs in LC may provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment strategy for LC.},

In mammals this regulation is primarily carried out by repression of translation. miRNAs play important roles in homeostatic processes such as development, cell proliferation and cell death. Recently the dysregulation of miRNAs has been linked to cancer initiation and progression, indicating that miRNAs may play roles as tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes. The role of miRNAs in apoptosis is not fully understood, however, evidence is mounting that miRNAs are important in this process. The dysregulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis may provide a mechanism for cancer development and resistance to cancer therapy. This review examines the biosynthesis of miRNA, the mechanisms of miRNA target regulation and the involvement of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of human cancer. It will include miRNAs involved in apoptosis, specifically those miRNAs involved in the regulation of apoptotic pathways and tumour suppressor/oncogene networks. It will also consider emerging evidence supporting a role for miRNAs in modulating sensitivity to anti-cancer therapy.},

However, sample type, processing and RNA extraction methods can have a substantial impact on the results of miRNA profiling, and therefore quality and quantity assessment is recommended.Biogenesis of miRNAs occurs through multiple steps and includes the intermediate primary miRNA and precursor miRNA forms, as well as post-transcriptional nucleotide additions and deletions, leading to 'isomiRs'. Choice of platform and analysis in miRNA profiling should include consideration of the need to distinguish between different forms of miRNAs.Three main approaches are currently well established for miRNA profiling: quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), hybridization-based methods (for example, DNA microarrays) and high-throughput sequencing (that is, RNA sequencing). The optimal choice of platform depends on the specific experimental goals.Analysis of miRNA-profiling data typically includes data processing, data quality assessment, data normalization and calculation of differential expression. The optimal approach to data analysis depends on the platform selected and the nature of the experiment.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether racial differences in gene and miRNA expression translates to differences in lung tumor biology with clinical relevance in African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs). Experimental Design: The NCI-Maryland Case Control Study includes seven Baltimore City hospitals and is overrepresented with AA patients ({$\sim$}40\%). Patients that underwent curative NSCLC surgery between 1998 and 2014 were enrolled. Comparative molecular profiling used mRNA (n = 22 AAs and 19 EAs) and miRNA (n = 42 AAs and 55 EAs) expression arrays to track differences in paired fresh frozen normal tissues and lung tumor specimens from AAs and EAs. Pathway enrichment, predicted drug response, tumor microenvironment infiltration, cancer immunotherapy antigen profiling, and miRNA target enrichment were assessed. Results: AA-enriched differential gene expression was characterized by stem cell and invasion pathways. Differential gene expression in lung tumors from EAs was primarily characterized by cell proliferation pathways. Population-specific gene expression was partly driven by population-specific miRNA expression profiles. Drug susceptibility predictions revealed a strong inverse correlation between AA resistance and EA sensitivity to the same panel of drugs. Statistically significant differences in M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration were observed in AAs (P {$<$} 0.05); however, PD-L1, PD-L2 expression was similar between both. Conclusions: Comparative transcriptomic profiling revealed clear differences in lung tumor biology between AAs and EAs. Increased participation by AAs in lung cancer clinical trials are needed to integrate, and leverage, transcriptomic differences with other clinical information to maximize therapeutic benefit in both AAs and EAs.

Activation foci from 12 studies encompassing 475 individuals, i.e., 213 suicide attempters and 262 psychiatric controls were subjected to meta-analytical study using anatomic or activation likelihood estimation (ALE).Result: Activation likelihood estimation revealed structural deficits and functional changes in association with a history of suicidal behavior. Structural findings included reduced volumes of the rectal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and caudate nucleus. Functional differences between study groups included an increased reactivity of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.Discussion: A history of suicidal behavior appears to be associated with (probably interrelated) structural deficits and functional overactivation in brain areas, which contribute to a decision-making network. The findings suggest that a vulnerability to suicidal behavior can be defined in terms of a reduced motivational control over the intentional behavioral reaction to salient negative stimuli.},

Machine learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown potential in predicting response for individual patients, which may enable personalized treatment decisions and increase treatment efficacy. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of MRI-guided response prediction in MDD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies using MRI to predict single-subject response to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. Classification performance was calculated using a bivariate model and expressed as area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, we analyzed differences in classification performance between different interventions and MRI modalities. Meta-analysis of 22 samples including 957 patients showed an overall area under the bivariate summary receiver operating curve of 0.84 (95\% CI 0.81\textendash 0.87), sensitivity of 77\% (95\% CI 71\textendash 82), and specificity of 79\% (95\% CI 73\textendash 84). Although classification performance was higher for electroconvulsive therapy outcome prediction (n\,=\,285, 80\% sensitivity, 83\% specificity) than medication outcome prediction (n\,=\,283, 75\% sensitivity, 72\% specificity), there was no significant difference in classification performance between treatments or MRI modalities. Prediction of treatment response using machine learning analysis of MRI data is promising but should not yet be implemented into clinical practice. Future studies with more generalizable samples and external validation are needed to establish the potential of MRI to realize individualized patient care in MDD.},

In this regard, numerous research groups are focusing their efforts upon identifying specific, highly stable, endogenous c-mRNAs. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the reference genes currently used in the study of various pathologies, offering to researchers the opportunity to select the appropriate molecules for c-miRNA levels normalization, when their choosing is based upon literature data.},

  abstract = {A combination of different risk factors, such as genetic, environmental and psychological factors, together with immune system, stress response, brain neuroplasticity and the regulation of neurotransmitters, is thought to lead to the development of major depressive disorder (MDD). A growing number of studies have tried to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MDD by analysing the expression levels of genes involved in such biological processes. These studies have shown that MDD is not just a brain disorder, but also a body disorder, and this is mainly due to the interplay between the periphery and the Central Nervous System (CNS). To this purpose, most of the studies conducted so far have mainly dedicated to the analysis of the gene expression levels using postmortem brain tissue as well as peripheral blood samples of MDD patients. In this paper, we reviewed the current literature on candidate gene expression alterations and the few existing transcriptomics studies in MDD focusing on inflammation, neuroplasticity, neurotransmitters and stress-related genes. Moreover, we focused our attention on studies, which have investigated mRNA levels as biomarkers to predict therapy outcomes. This is important as many patients do not respond to antidepressant medication or could experience adverse side effects, leading to the interruption of treatment. Unfortunately, the right choice of antidepressant for each individual still remains largely a matter of taking an educated guess.},

The miRNA machinery interacts with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which functions as translational repressor. We show that miR-125b and miR-132, as well as several other miRNAs, are associated with FMRP in mouse brain. miR-125b and miR-132 had largely opposing effects on dendritic spine morphology and synaptic physiology in hippocampal neurons. FMRP knockdown ameliorates the effect of miRNA overexpression on spine morphology. We identified NMDA receptor subunit NR2A as a target of miR-125b and show that NR2A mRNA is specifically associated with FMRP in brain. In hippocampal neurons, NR2A expression is negatively regulated through its 3' UTR by FMRP, miR-125b, and Argonaute 1. Regulation of NR2A 3'UTR by FMRP depends in part on miR-125b. Because NMDA receptor subunit composition profoundly affects synaptic plasticity, these observations have implications for the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome, in which plasticity is altered.},

Using both the editing levels and microRNA editing expression, we detected deregulated microRNA editing events between NSCLC tumor and normal tissues. Interestingly, and for the first time, we also detected editing sites in the microRNA cargo of circulating exosomes, providing the potential to non-invasively discriminate between normal and tumor samples.

Therefore, it is imperative to find more reliable biomarker(s). Methods: We performed one of most sensitive qRT-PCR assays, S-Poly(T) Plus, to select differently expressed miRNAs from genome-wide miRNA profiling. miRNA candidates were validated through a three-phase selection and two validation processes with 437 NSCLC cases and 415 controls. Results: A unique set of 7 and 9 miRNAs differed significantly in adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples compared with those in controls, of which, there were 5 universal biomarkers for NSCLC (ADC or SCC). Ten of 11 miRNAs could discriminate early stage (stage I) of NSCLC from healthy individuals. Risk score was obtained from the validation set-1 and was tested using the ROC curves with a high area under ROC curve of 0.89 in ADC and 0.96 in SCC. Ultimately, potential biomarkers and the risk score were verified by the validation set-2 with a sensitivity of 94\% and a specificity of 91.6\% in ADC, and a sensitivity of 98.5\% and a specificity of 51.5\% in SCC, respectively. Conclusions: Taken together, 7 miRNAs and 9 miRNAs may provide noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in ADC and SCC, respectively. Impact: On the basis of our sensitive and accurate method, we hope that these candidate miRNAs may have strong impact on the early lung cancer diagnosis.},

We examined if presence of lung cancer is reflected in whole blood microRNA expression as well, possibly because of a systemic response. Locked nucleic acid microarrays were used to quantify the global expression of microRNAs in whole blood of 22 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 23 controls, ten of whom had a radiographically detected non-cancerous lung nodule and the other 13 were at high risk for developing lung cancer because of a smoking history of {$>$}20 pack-years. Cases and controls differed significantly for age with a mean difference of 10.7 years, but not for gender, race, smoking history, blood hemoglobin, platelet count, or white blood cell count. Of 1282 quantified human microRNAs, 395 (31\%) were identified as expressed in the study's subjects, with 96 (24\%) differentially expressed between cases and controls. Classification analyses of microRNA expression data were performed using linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) and top-scoring pairs (TSP) methods, and classifiers to identify presence of lung adenocarcinoma were internally cross-validated. In leave-one-out cross-validation, the TSP classifiers had sensitivity and specificity of 91\% and 100\%, respectively. The values with SVM were both 91\%. In a Monte Carlo cross-validation, average sensitivity and specificity values were 86\% and 97\%, respectively, with TSP, and 88\% and 89\%, respectively, with SVM. MicroRNAs miR-190b, miR-630, miR-942, and miR-1284 were the most frequent constituents of the classifiers generated during the analyses. These results suggest that whole blood microRNA expression profiles can be used to distinguish lung cancer cases from clinically relevant controls. Further studies are needed to validate this observation, including in non-adenocarcinomatous lung cancers, and to clarify upon the confounding effect of age.},

Exiqon\textregistered{} MiRCURY\texttrademark{} microarrays were used to quantify microRNAs in RNA isolates. Quantification was also performed using Taqman\texttrademark{} microRNA reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays for five microRNAs whose lung cancer-diagnostic potential had been suggested in seven published studies. Of the 1,941 human mature microRNAs detectable with the microarray platform, 598 (31\%) were identified as expressed and reliably quantified among the study's subjects. However, none of the microRNAs was differentially expressed between cases and controls (P {$>$}0.05 at false discovery rate {$<$}5\% in test using empirical Bayes-moderated t statistics). In classification analyses with leave-one-out internal cross-validation, cases and controls could be identified by microRNA expression with 47\% and 50\% accuracy with support vector machines and top-scoring pair methods, respectively. Cases and controls did not differ for RT-PCR-based measurements of any of the five microRNAs whose biomarker potential had been suggested by seven previous studies. Additionally, no difference for microRNA expression was noticed in microarray-based microRNA profiles of whole blood of 12 stage IA-IIIB NSCLC cases before and three-four weeks after tumor resection. These findings show that whole blood microRNA expression profiles lack diagnostic value for high-risk screening of NSCLC, though such value may exist for selective sub-groups of NSCLC and control populations.},

Seventy-three nonpsychotic patients were treated in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy (mean, 44 sessions). Two thirds of the therapists were residents in psychiatry; one third were more experienced. The two main composite outcome measures, measured at termination, were Raw Gain (residualized) and Rated Benefits, which intercorrelated at .76. Most patients improved and showed a considerable range of benefits. The clinical observers' direct predictions of Rated Benefits were highest (.27, P \&lt;.05). The success of the predictive measures were generally insignificant, and the best of them were in the .2 to .3 range, meaning that only 5\% to 10\% of the outcome variance was predicted. The prognostic Index Interview variables did the best (eg, emotional freedom composite, .30; a crossvalidation for 30 patients was.39 (P \&lt;.05). Neither the therapist measures nor the early psychotherapy session measures predicted significantly. Reanalysis of the similar Chicago Counseling Center study, in our terms, showed a similar low level of prediction success, eg, adequacy of functioning, marital status match, and length of treatment predicted significantly in both studies.},

One of the most common scenarios encountered involves the comparison of 2 groups, which includes research designs that are experimental (e.g., random assignment to treatment vs. placebo conditions) and nonexperimental (e.g., testing for gender differences). Familiar measures such as the standardized mean difference (d) or the point-biserial correlation (rpb) characterize the magnitude of the difference between groups, but these effect size measures are sensitive to a number of additional influences. For example, R. E. McGrath and G. J. Meyer (2006) showed that rpb is sensitive to sample base rates, and extending their analysis to situations of unequal variances reveals that d is, too. The probability-based measure A, the nonparametric generalization of what K. O. McGraw and S. P. Wong (1992) called the common language effect size statistic, is insensitive to base rates and more robust to several other factors (e.g., extreme scores, nonlinear transformations). In addition to its excellent generalizability across contexts, A is easy to understand and can be obtained from standard computer output or through simple hand calculations.

Moreover, erythrocyte-derived miRNAs have been reported to be potential biomarkers of specific diseases. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of miRNAs derived from erythrocytes remain unclear. Based on a review of previously published literature, we discuss several possible pathways by which RBC miRNAs may function and propose that RBCs may serve as repositories of miRNAs in the circulatory system and participate in the regulation of gene expression mainly via the transfer of miRNAs from erythrocyte extracellular vesicles (EVs). In the whole blood, there are still other important cell types such as leukocytes and platelets harboring functional miRNAs, and hemolysis also exists, which limit the abundance of miRNAs as disease biomarkers, and thus, miRNA studies on RBCs may be impacted. In the future, the role of RBCs in the regulation of normal physiological functions of the body and the entire circulatory system under pathological states, if any, remains to be determined.},

In this work, we apply fast linear-SVM methods to the explicit form of polynomially mapped data and investigate implementation issues. The approach enjoys fast training and testing, but may sometimes achieve accuracy close to that of using highly nonlinear kernels. Empirical experiments show that the proposed method is useful for certain large-scale data sets.

  abstract = {Background: Micro(mi)RNAs, potent gene expression regulators associated with tumorigenesis, are stable, abundant circulating molecules, and detectable in plasma. Thus, miRNAs could potentially be useful in early lung cancer detection. We aimed to identify circulating miRNA signatures in plasma from patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and to verify whether miRNAs regulate lung oncogenesis pathways. Methods: RNA isolated from 139 plasma samples (40 LUAD, 38 LUSC; 61 healthy/non-diseased individuals) were divided into discovery (38 patients; 21 controls for expression quantification using an 800-miRNA panel; Nanostring nCounter\textregistered ) and validation (40 patients; 40 controls; TaqMan\textregistered{} RT-qPCR) cohorts. Elastic net, Maximizing-R-Square Analysis (MARSA), and C-Statistics were applied for miRNA signature identification. Results: When compared to healthy individuals, 580 of 606 deregulated miRNAs in LUAD and 221 of 226 deregulated miRNAs in LUSC had significantly increased levels. Among the 10 most significantly overexpressed miRNAs, 6 were common to patients with LUAD and LUSC. Further analysis identified three signatures composed of 12 miRNAs. Signatures included miRNAs commonly overexpressed in patient plasma. Enriched pathways included target genes modulated by three miRNAs in the C-Statistics signature: miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-451a. Conclusions: The 3-miRNA signature (miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-451a) had high specificity (100\%) and sensitivity (84\%) to predict cancer (LUAD and LUSC). These miRNAs are predicted to modulate genes and pathways with known roles in lung tumorigenesis, including EGFR, K-RAS, and PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting that the 3-miRNA signature is biologically relevant in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.},

  abstract = {Worldwide over 1 million people die due to lung cancer each year. It is estimated that cigarette smoking explains almost 90\% of lung cancer risk in men and 70 to 80\% in women. Clinically evident lung cancers have multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. These abnormalities may result in activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Chronic inflammation, which is known to promote cancer, may result both from smoking and from genetic abnormalities. These mediators in turn may be responsible for increased macrophage recruitment, delayed neutrophil clearance, and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the pulmonary environment presents a unique milieu in which lung carcinogenesis proceeds in complicity with the host cellular network. The pulmonary diseases that are associated with the greatest risk for lung cancer are characterized by abundant and deregulated inflammation. Pulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema are characterized by profound abnormalities in inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The cytokines and growth factors aberrantly produced in COPD and the developing tumor microenvironment have been found to have deleterious properties that simultaneously pave the way for both epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) and destruction of specific host cell\textendash mediated immune responses. Full definition of these pathways will afford the opportunity to intervene in specific inflammatory events mediating lung tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy.},

It certainly seems as though better use could be made of the observations by taking their magnitudes into account. However, since the sign test is optimum at level a for this inclusive set of null distributions, any procedure which considers magnitudes would be a better test at level a only for some smaller and more restrictive set of null distributions. Such procedures are of special relevance if the restricted set is the one of interest anyway, or if the ``restriction'' of the null hypothesis can reasonably be assumed as a part of the model, so that the restricted hypothesis essentially amounts to the unrestricted one above. Furthermore, their exact levels may vary only slightly under the kinds of departure from assumptions which are likely, and their increased power may well be worth the small price.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report is to present a systematic and critical review of the more recent literature data about structural abnormalities detected by magnetic ressonance in anxiety disorders. METHOD: A review of the literature in the last five years was conducted by a search of the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO indexing services using the following key words: "anxiety", "panic", "agoraphobia", "social anxiety", "posttraumatic" and "obsessive-compulsive", crossed one by one with "magnetic resonance", "voxel-based", "ROI" and "morphometry". RESULTS: We selected 134 articles and 41 of them were included in our review. Recent studies have shown significant morphological abnormalities in various brain regions of patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls. Despite some apparently contradictory findings, perhaps reflecting the variability and limitations of the methodologies used, certain brain regions appear to be altered in a consistent and relatively specific manner in some anxiety disorders. These include the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex in posttraumatic stress disorder and the orbitofrontal cortex in obsessive-compulsive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The present review indicates that structural neuroimaging has contributed to a better understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety disorders. Further development of neuroimaging techniques, better sample standardization and the integration of data across neuroimaging modalities may extend progress in this area.},

  abstract = {Although differences in clinical characteristics exist between major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), consistent structural brain abnormalities that distinguish the disorders have not been identified.To investigate structural brain changes in MDD using meta-analysis of primary studies; assess the effects of medication, demographic, and clinical variables; and compare the findings with those of a meta-analysis of studies on BD.The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies from January 1, 1980, to February 2, 2010.Two hundred twenty-five studies that used magnetic resonance imaging or x-ray computed tomography to compare brain structure in patients with MDD with that of controls were included in an online database, and 143 that measured common brain structures were selected for meta-analysis.Twenty-five variables, including demographic and clinical data, were extracted from each study, when available. For the meta-analysis, mean structure size and standard deviation were extracted for continuous variables, and the proportion of patients and controls with an abnormality in brain structure was extracted for categorical variables.Compared with the structure of a healthy brain, MDD was associated with lateral ventricle enlargement; larger cerebrospinal fluid volume; and smaller volumes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, frontal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex, and gyrus rectus. Patients during depressive episodes had significantly smaller hippocampal volume than patients during remission. Compared with BD patients, those with MDD had reduced rates of deep white matter hyperintensities, increased corpus callosum cross-sectional area, and smaller hippocampus and basal ganglia. Both disorders were associated with increased lateral ventricle volume and increased rates of subcortical gray matter hyperintensities compared with healthy controls.The meta-analyses revealed structural brain abnormalities in MDD that are distinct from those observed in BD. These findings may aid investigators attempting to discriminate mood disorders using structural magnetic resonance imaging data.},

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors.

  abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. It can be difficult to discern the symptoms of PTSD and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities focus on different aspects, which may provide complementary information for PTSD discrimination. However, none of the published studies assessed the diagnostic potential of multimodal MRI in identifying individuals with and without PTSD. In the current study, we investigated whether the complementary information conveyed by multimodal MRI scans could be combined to improve PTSD classification performance. Structural and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans were conducted on 17 PTSD patients, 20 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (TEC) and 20 non-traumatized healthy controls (HC). Gray matter volume (GMV), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and regional homogeneity were extracted as classification features, and in order to integrate the information of structural and functional MRI data, the extracted features were combined by a multi-kernel combination strategy. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to distinguish the subjects at individual level. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method. In the pairwise comparison of PTSD, TEC, and HC groups, classification accuracies obtained by the proposed approach were 2.70, 2.50, and 2.71\% higher than the best single feature way, with the accuracies of 89.19, 90.00, and 67.57\% for PTSD vs. HC, TEC vs. HC, and PTSD vs. TEC respectively. The proposed approach could improve PTSD identification at individual level. Additionally, it provides preliminary support to develop the multimodal MRI method as a clinical diagnostic aid.},

  abstract = {Background Detection of lung cancer at an early stage by sensitive screening tests could be an important strategy to improving prognosis. Our objective was to identify a panel of circulating microRNAs in plasma that will contribute to early detection of lung cancer. Material and Methods Plasma samples from 100 early stage (I to IIIA) non\textendash small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 100 non-cancer controls were screened for 754 circulating microRNAs via qRT-PCR, using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. Logistic regression with a lasso penalty was used to select a panel of microRNAs that discriminate between cases and controls. Internal validation of model discrimination was conducted by calculating the bootstrap optimism-corrected AUC for the selected model. Results We identified a panel of 24 microRNAs with optimum classification performance. The combination of these 24 microRNAs alone could discriminate lung cancer cases from non-cancer controls with an AUC of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.87-0.95). This classification improved to an AUC of 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.90-0.97) following addition of sex, age and smoking status to the model. Internal validation of the model suggests that the discriminatory power of the panel will be high when applied to independent samples with a corrected AUC of 0.78 for the 24-miRNA panel alone. Conclusion Our 24-microRNA predictor improves lung cancer prediction beyond that of known risk factors.},

More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being the most common histological subtype (approximately 40\%). In the absence of reliable screening biomarkers for early diagnosis, most patients with LUAD are inevitably diagnosed at an advanced stage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated within plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be suitable for use as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for aggressive malignancies, including LUAD. In this study, we first investigated the miRNA profiles of plasma-derived EVs from LUAD patients and healthy donors, and then systematically evaluated the expression patterns of selected plasma-derived EV miRNAs in a large cohort of patients with LUAD and healthy controls. Notably, we observed that miR-451a, miR-194-5p, and miR-486-5p were significantly increased in EVs from LUAD patients, compared to healthy controls. The area under the curve values for the three miRNAs were 0.9040 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.8633\textendash 0.9447) for miR-451a, 0.7492 (95\% CI, 0.6992\textendash 0.7992) for miR-194-5p, and 0.9574 (95\% CI, 0.9378\textendash 0.9769) for miR-486-5p, while the AUC of the combination of these three miRNAs was 0.9650. Thus, these results suggest that these EV miRNAs may be promising candidates for the development of highly effective, noninvasive biomarkers for early LUAD diagnosis., Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being the most common histological subtype (approximately 40\%).
