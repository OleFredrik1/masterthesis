\epigraph{Overall the net consequence of hospitals is negative. Now that is just a guess, and it could easily be wrong, but it also could not be wrong.}{\textit{Jordan B. Peterson} \\ Professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Toronto}

This is a master's thesis for a master's degree in informatics with a specialization in artificial intelligence, conducted at NTNU with Pål Sætrom as supervisor. I want to thank friends and family for their support.

\iffalse
The preface includes the facts - what type of project, where it is conducted, who supervised and any acknowledgements you wish to give.
