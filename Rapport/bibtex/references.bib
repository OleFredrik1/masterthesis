  abstract = {Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, is most frequently detected through imaging tests. In this study, we investigated serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as a possible early screening tool for resectable lung cancer. First, we used serum samples from participants with and without lung cancer to comprehensively create 2588 miRNAs profiles; next, we established a diagnostic model based on the combined expression levels of two miRNAs (miR-1268b and miR-6075) in the discovery set (208 lung cancer patients and 208 non-cancer participants). The model displayed a sensitivity of 99\% and specificity of 99\% in the validation set (1358 patients and 1970 non-cancer participants) and exhibited high sensitivity regardless of histological type and pathological TNM stage of the cancer. Moreover, the diagnostic index markedly decreased after lung cancer resection. Thus, the model we developed has the potential to markedly improve screening for resectable lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the first cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and its early detection is currently the main available strategy to improve disease prognosis. While early diagnosis can be successfully achieved through tomography-based population screenings in high-risk individuals, simple methodologies are needed for effective cancer prevention programs. We developed a test, based on the detection of 34 microRNAs (miRNAs) from serum, that could identify patients with early stage non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) in a population of asymptomatic high-risk individuals with 80\% accuracy. The signature could assign disease probability accurately either in asymptomatic or symptomatic patients, is able to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions, and to capture the onset of the malignant disease in individual patients over time. Thus, our test displays a number of features of clinical relevance that project its utility in programs for the early detection of NSCLC.},

Critical issues remain the frequency of unnecessary treatments and impact on mortality, indicating the need for biomarkers of aggressive disease. We explored microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of lung tumors, normal lung tissues and plasma samples from cases with variable prognosis identified in a completed spiral-CT screening trial with extensive follow-up. miRNA expression patterns significantly distinguished: (i) tumors from normal lung tissues, (ii) tumor histology and growth rate, (iii) clinical outcome, and (iv) year of lung cancer CT detection. Interestingly, miRNA profiles in normal lung tissues also displayed remarkable associations with clinical features, suggesting the influence of a permissive microenvironment for tumor development. miRNA expression analyses in plasma samples collected 1\textendash 2 y before the onset of disease, at the time of CT detection and in disease-free smokers enrolled in the screening trial, resulted in the generation of miRNA signatures with strong predictive, diagnostic, and prognostic potential (area under the ROC curve {$\geq$} 0.85). These signatures were validated in an independent cohort from a second randomized spiral-CT trial. These results indicate a role for miRNAs in lung tissues and plasma as molecular predictors of lung cancer development and aggressiveness and have theoretical and clinical implication for lung cancer management.},

If identified at an early stage, surgical resection of NSCLC offers a favourable prognosis, with published case series reporting 5-year survival rates of up to 70\% for small, localized tumours (stage I). However, most patients (approx. 75\%) have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (stage III/IV) and despite significant developments in the oncological management of late stage lung cancer over recent years, survival remains poor.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) processed by exosomes can be detected by liquid biopsy. To objectively evaluate the discriminative ability of miRNAs from whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma, we analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma of 10 lung adenocarcinoma and 9 granuloma patients. With Monte-Carlo feature selection method, the top discriminative miRNAs in whole plasma, EV and EV-free plasma were identified, and they were quite different. Using the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) method, we learned the classification rules: in whole plasma, granuloma patients did not express hsa-miR-223-3p while the lung adenocarcinoma patients expressed hsa-miR-223-3p; in EV, the hsa-miR-23b-3p was highly expressed in granuloma patients but not lung adenocarcinoma patients; in EV-free plasma, hsa-miR-376a-3p was expressed in granuloma patients but barely expressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients. For prediction performance, whole plasma had the highest weighted accuracy and EV outperformed EV-free plasma. Our results suggested that EV can be used as lung cancer biomarker. However, since it is less stable and not easy to detect, there are still technological difficulties to overcome.},

  abstract = {Background: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and it shows a high incidence worldwide. Circulating microRNAs have been proposed as diagnostic indicators of lung cancer, but inconsistent results in the literature have prevented their widespread use in diagnosis. The present meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of circulating microRNAs for lung cancer. Methods: Several research databases were searched systematically for studies of the accuracy of circulating microRNAs as diagnostic indicators of lung cancer. Results from different studies were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were used to assess the overall performance of microRNA-based assays. Results: Thirteen publications were included in the meta-analysis. The following summary estimates were obtained for the performance of circulating microRNAs in lung cancer diagnosis: sensitivity, 0.85 (95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.83\textendash 0.87); specificity, 0.84 (95\% CI: 0.81\textendash 0.86); positive likelihood ratio, 5.23 (95\% CI: 3.75\textendash 7.29); negative likelihood ratio, 0.20 (95\% CI: 0.14\textendash 0.27); and diagnostic odds ratio, 31.77 (95\% CI: 16.98\textendash 59.42). The SROC curve indicated a maximum joint sensitivity and specificity of 0.85, with an area under the curve of 0.92. Conclusion: Circulating microRNAs show significant potential as diagnostic markers of lung cancer. The results of this meta-analysis justify larger, more rigorous studies to confirm such a diagnostic role.},

Statistical analyses highlighted the following: a\,=\,55 miRNAs deregulated in tumor serum, b\,=\,27 miRNAs deregulated in tumor tissues, and c\,=\,2 miRNAs deregulated both in tumor serum and in tumor tissues. MiRwalk tool and enrichment pathway analyses selected some miRNAs whose target genes are correlated with the main pathways involved in NSCLC tumorigenesis. The altered expression of the selected miR-486-5p (a), miR-29c* (b), and miR-133a (c) was confirmed in the validation set (n\,=\,40). MiR-486-5p had a higher expression in tumor serum than in tumor tissues (P\,=\,0.004), and miR-29c* showed a lower expression in tumor tissues than in tumor serum (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). MiR-133a had a not different expression in both tumor serum and tumor tissues (P\,=\,0.07). The low level of miR-486-5p expression in the serum of affected patients was associated with a worse time to progression of disease (P\,=\,0.010), and serum level of miR-486-5p was a significant prognostic indicator of NSCLC (adjusted hazard ratio\,=\,0.179, P\,=\,0.019).

This study aimed to discover the potential miRNA biomarkers for early detection of NSCLC.MethodsTotal circulating miRNAs were extracted from six patients and six volunteers and run on the miRNA chip. The differentially expressed miRNAs acquired by data mining were intersected with chip results, and qRT-PCR were carried out. Then the differentially miRNAs were validated by using a validation cohort (120 participants). ROC curves were established to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the differentially circulating miRNAs. The target genes of the differential miRNAs were identified using the miRTarBase database, and follow-up GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were conducted.ResultsWe identified 577 miRNA which screened according to the criteria (fold change {$>$} 2 and p value {$<$} 0.05). Among them, seven circulating miRNAs passed additional filtering based on data mining. These miRNAs were further validated in the training and validation cohort. miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 were differentially expressed in the patients' serum, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of these miRNAs were 0.789, 0.792, and 0.711, respectively. When using them as a combination to discriminate healthy volunteers from patients, the AUC reached 0.828 (95\% CI, 0.750\textendash 0.905, p = 0.000) with a sensitivity of 86.7\% and specificity of 71.7\%. The follow-up enrichment analysis showed that target genes of three miRNA were associated with tumorigenesis and progression, such as cell cycle and P53 signaling pathway.ConclusionsThe combination of miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 can be utilized to distinguish healthy individuals and early-stage NSCLC patients.ImpactThe combination of miR-492, miR-590-3p, and miR-631 might be a promising serum biomarker in patients for the early diagnosis of NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Importance: The overall low survival rate of patients with lung cancer calls for improved detection tools to enable better treatment options and improved patient outcomes. Multivariable molecular signatures, such as blood-borne microRNA (miRNA) signatures, may have high rates of sensitivity and specificity but require additional studies with large cohorts and standardized measurements to confirm the generalizability of miRNA signatures. Objective: To investigate the use of blood-borne miRNAs as potential circulating markers for detecting lung cancer in an extended cohort of symptomatic patients and control participants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, cohort study included patients from case-control and cohort studies (TREND and COSYCONET) with 3102 patients being enrolled by convenience sampling between March 3, 2009, and March 19, 2018. For the cohort study TREND, population sampling was performed. Clinical diagnoses were obtained for 3046 patients (606 patients with non-small cell and small cell lung cancer, 593 patients with nontumor lung diseases, 883 patients with diseases not affecting the lung, and 964 unaffected control participants). No samples were removed because of experimental issues. The collected data were analyzed between April 2018 and November 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy using miRNA signatures for detection of lung cancer. Results: A total of 3102 patients with a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (16.2) years were enrolled. Data on the sex of the participants were available for 2856 participants; 1727 (60.5\%) were men. Genome-wide miRNA profiles of blood samples from 3046 individuals were evaluated by machine-learning methods. Three classification scenarios were investigated by splitting the samples equally into training and validation sets. First, a 15-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients diagnosed with lung cancer from all other individuals in the validation set with an accuracy of 91.4\% (95\% CI, 91.0\%-91.9\%), a sensitivity of 82.8\% (95\% CI, 81.5\%-84.1\%), and a specificity of 93.5\% (95\% CI, 93.2\%-93.8\%). Second, a 14-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with nontumor lung diseases in the validation set with an accuracy of 92.5\% (95\% CI, 92.1\%-92.9\%), sensitivity of 96.4\% (95\% CI, 95.9\%-96.9\%), and specificity of 88.6\% (95\% CI, 88.1\%-89.2\%). Third, a 14-miRNA signature from the training set was used to distinguish patients with early-stage lung cancer from all individuals without lung cancer in the validation set with an accuracy of 95.9\% (95\% CI, 95.7\%-96.2\%), sensitivity of 76.3\% (95\% CI, 74.5\%-78.0\%), and specificity of 97.5\% (95\% CI, 97.2\%-97.7\%). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of the study suggest that the identified patterns of miRNAs may be used as a component of a minimally invasive lung cancer test, complementing imaging, sputum cytology, and biopsy tests.},

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {$<$}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

  abstract = {Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths all over the world, among both men and women, with an incidence of over 200,000 new cases per year coupled with a very high mortality rate. LC comprises of two major clinicopathological categories: small-cell (SCLC) and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, usually 18\textendash 25 nucleotides long, which repress protein translation through binding to complementary target mRNAs. The miRNAs regulate many biological processes including cell cycle regulation, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, neuronal patterning, and aging. This review summarizes the role of miRNAs expression in LC. It also provides information about the miRNAs as biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer. Understanding the role of miRNAs in LC may provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment strategy for LC.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify tumor-derived exosomal biomarkers that are able to discriminate between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as a noninvasive method in the early diagnosis of non\textendash small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Experimental Design: Tumor-derived exosomes from the plasma of early-stage NSCLC patients were isolated. Exosomal miRNA profiling of 46 stage I NSCLC patients and 42 healthy individuals was performed using miRNA-seq to identify and validate adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific miRNAs. The diagnostic accuracy of select miRNAs was tested further with an additional 60 individuals. Results: There were 11 and 6 miRNAs expressed at remarkably higher levels, 13 and 8 miRNAs expressed at lower levels in adenocarcinoma and SCC patients, respectively, compared with healthy volunteers. Distinct adenocarcinoma- and SCC-specific exosomal miRNAs were validated. The reliability of miRNA-seq data was verified with several demonstrated diagnostic potential miRNAs for NSCLC and other carcinomas, as reported in previous studies, such as let-7, miR-21, miR-24, and miR-486. The results indicated that miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p, and miR-361-5p were adenocarcinoma-specific, and miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were SCC-specific. The diagnostic accuracy of three combination miRNA panels was evaluated using an AUC value of 0.899, 0.936, and 0.911 for detecting NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, and SCC, respectively. Conclusions: Tumor-derived exosomal miRNAs, adenocarcinoma-specific miR-181-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e-3p and miR-361-5p, and SCC-specific miR-10b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-320b were observed by next-generation sequencing, and their diagnostic accuracy were verified. These miRNAs may be promising and effective candidates in the development of highly sensitive, noninvasive biomarkers for early NSCLC diagnosis.

We generated genome-wide miRNA profiles from serum of patients and controls from the population-based Janus Serum Bank (JSB) and analysed them by bioinformatics and artificial intelligence approaches. JSB contains sera from 318,628 originally healthy persons, more than 96,000 of whom developed cancer. We selected 210 serum samples from patients with lung, colon or breast cancer at three time points prior to diagnosis (up to 32 years prior to diagnosis with median 5 years interval between TPs), one time-point after diagnosis and from individually matched controls. The controls were matched on age and year of all pre-diagnostic sampling time-points for the corresponding case.Using ANOVA we report 70 significantly deregulated markers (adjusted p-value{$<$}0.05). The driver for the significance was the diagnostic time point (miR-575, miR-6821-5p, miR-630 with adjusted p-values{$<$}10-10). Further, 91miRNAs were differently expressed in pre-diagnostic samples as compared to controls (nominal p {$<$} 0.05). Self-organized maps (SOMs)indicated larges effects in lung cancer samples while breast cancer samples showed the least pronounced changes. SOMsalsohighlighted cancer and time point specific miRNA dys-regulation. Intriguingly, a detailed breakdown of the results highlighted that 51\% of all miRNAs were highly specific, either for a time-point or a cancer entity. Pathway analysis highlighted 12 pathways including Hipo signalling and ABC transporters.Our results indicate that tumours may be indicated by serum miRNAs decades prior the clinical manifestation.},

Serum EVs were isolated from NSCLC patients (n = 31) and control subjects (n = 21). RNA was isolated from EVs and reverse transcription reaction was performed. Relative levels of miR-23a, miR-361, miR-1228 and miR-let7i were assessed in real-time qPCR using TaqMan probes. Analysis was based on the 2-{$\Delta\Delta$}CT method. Statistically significant lower levels of miR-23a and miR-let7i were observed among NSCLC patients vs. control group: miR-23a, 0.054 vs. 0.107; miR-let7i, 0.193 vs. 0.369 (p = 0.003, p = 0.005, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the diagnostic potential of each individual serum EV-derived miRNA with an area under the curve AUC = 0.744 for miR-23a (p = 0.0003), 0.733 for miR-let7i (p = 0.0007). The decreased level of miR-23a in patients correlated with metastasis to lymph nodes and with AJCC tumor staging system. The results demonstrate that miR-23a and miR-let7i may prove clinically useful as significant, non-invasive markers in NSCLC diagnosis. Additionally, changing profile level of miR-23a that correlates with cancer development may be considered as an NSCLC progression marker.},

With the present study we wanted to investigate if miRNA blood signatures are also suited to differentiate lung cancer patients from COPD patients. We compared the expression of 863 human miRNAs in blood cells of lung cancer patients, COPD patients, and healthy controls. The miRNA pattern from patients with lung cancer and COPD were more similar to each other than to the healthy controls. However, we were able to discriminate lung cancer patients and COPD patients with 90.4\% accuracy, 89.2\% specificity, and 91.7\% sensitivity. In total, 140 miRNAs were significant for the comparison COPD and controls, 61 miRNAs were significant for the comparison lung cancer and controls, and 14 miRNAs were significant for the comparison lung cancer and COPD. Screening target databases yielded over 400 putative targets for those 14 miRNAs. The predicted mRNA targets of three of the 14 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in PBMCs of lung cancer patients compared to patients with non-malignant lung diseases. In conclusion, we showed that blood miRNA signatures are suitable to distinguish lung cancer from COPD.},

Here we provide longitudinal analysis of 1,205 miRNAs in plasma samples of 26 patients after lung cancer resection at 8 time points over a period of 18 months and compare them to 12 control patients. First, we report longitudinal changes with respect to the number of detected miRNAs over time and identified a significantly increased number of miRNAs in patients developing metastases (p = 0.0096). A quantitative analysis with respect to the expression level of the detected miRNAs revealed more significant changes in the miRNA levels in samples from patients without metastases compared to the non-cancer control patients. This analysis provided further evidence of miRNA plasma levels that are changing over time after tumor resection and correlate to patient outcome. Especially hsa-miR-197 could be validated by qRT-PCR as prognostic marker. Also for this miRNA, patients developing metastases had levels close to that of controls while patients that did not develop metastases showed a significant up-regulation., In conclusion, our data indicate that the overall miRNome of a patient that later develops metastases is less affected by surgery than the miRNome of a patient who does not show metastases. The relationship between altered plasma levels of specific miRNAs with the development of metastases would partially have gone undetected by an analysis at a single time point only.},

We validated this result in an independent set of 35 paired tumors and their adjacent normal tissues, as well as their sera that are collected before surgical resection or chemotherapy, and the results suggested that hsa-miR-96 may play an important role in NSCLC development and has great potential to be used as a noninvasive marker for diagnosing NSCLC. We predicted potential miRNA target mRNAs based on different methods (TargetScan and miRanda). Further classification of miRNA regulated genes based on their relationship with miRNAs revealed that hsa-miR-96 and certain other miRNAs tend to down-regulate their target mRNAs in NSCLC development, which have expression levels permissive to direct interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. In addition, we identified a significant correlation of miRNA regulation with genes coincide with high density of CpG islands, which suggests that miRNA may represent a primary regulatory mechanism governing basic cellular functions and cell differentiations, and such mechanism may be complementary to DNA methylation in repressing or activating gene expression.},

Nevertheless, the clinical transferability of such tests is uncertain due to still-insufficient standardization and optimization of methods to detect circulating miRNAs in the clinical setting. METHODS: We performed a series of tests to optimize the quantification of serum miRNAs that compose the miR-Test, a signature for lung cancer early detection, and systematically analyzed variables that could affect the performance of the test. We took advantage of a large-scale ({$>$}1000 samples) validation study of the miR-Test that we recently published, to evaluate, in clinical samples, the effects of analytical and preanalytical variables on the quantification of circulating miRNAs and the clinical output of the signature (risk score). RESULTS: We developed a streamlined and standardized pipeline for the processing of clinical serum samples that allows the isolation and analysis of circulating miRNAs by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, with a throughput compatible with screening trials. The major source of analytical variation came from RNA isolation from serum, which could be corrected by use of external (spike-in) or endogenous miRNAs as a reference for normalization. We also introduced standard operating procedures and QC steps to check for unspecific fluctuations that arise from the lack of standardized criteria in the collection or handling of the samples (preanalytical factors). CONCLUSIONS: We propose our methodology as a reference for the development of clinical-grade blood tests on the basis of miRNA detection.},

  abstract = {Circulating microRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA molecules that can be detected in bodily fluids without the need for major invasive procedures on patients. miRNAs have shown great promise as biomarkers for tumors to both assess their presence and to predict their type and subtype. Recently, thanks to the availability of miRNAs datasets, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to tumor classification. The results, however, are difficult to assess and interpret by medical experts because the algorithms exploit information from thousands of miRNAs. In this work, we propose a novel technique that aims at reducing the necessary information to the smallest possible set of circulating miRNAs. The dimensionality reduction achieved reflects a very important first step in a potential, clinically actionable, circulating miRNA-based precision medicine pipeline. While it is currently under discussion whether this first step can be taken, we demonstrate here that it is possible to perform classification tasks by exploiting a recursive feature elimination procedure that integrates a heterogeneous ensemble of high-quality, state-of-the-art classifiers on circulating miRNAs. Heterogeneous ensembles can compensate inherent biases of classifiers by using different classification algorithms. Selecting features then further eliminates biases emerging from using data from different studies or batches, yielding more robust and reliable outcomes. The proposed approach is first tested on a tumor classification problem in order to separate 10 different types of cancer, with samples collected over 10 different clinical trials, and later is assessed on a cancer subtype classification task, with the aim to distinguish triple negative breast cancer from other subtypes of breast cancer. Overall, the presented methodology proves to be effective and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

Thousands of these molecules have been discovered to date, and multiple miRNAs have been shown to coordinately fine-tune cellular processes key to organismal development, homeostasis, neurobiology, immunobiology, and control of infection. The fundamental regulatory role of miRNAs in a variety of biological processes suggests that differential expression of these transcripts may be exploited as a novel source of molecular biomarkers for many different disease pathologies or abnormalities. This has been emphasized by the recent discovery of remarkably stable miRNAs in mammalian biofluids, which may originate from intracellular processes elsewhere in the body. The potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease has mainly been demonstrated for various types of cancer. More recently, however, attention has focused on the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers of infectious disease; for example, human tuberculosis caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, sepsis caused by multiple infectious agents, and viral hepatitis. Here, we review these developments and discuss prospects and challenges for translating circulating miRNA into novel diagnostics for infectious disease.},

Proper control of miRNA expression is essential for maintaining a steady state of the cellular machinery. Recently, it was discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulate in the blood of both healthy and diseased patients, although ribonuclease is present in both plasma and serum. Most of the circulating miRNAs are included in lipid or lipoprotein complexes, such as apoptotic bodies, microvesicles, or exosomes, and are, therefore, highly stable. The existence of circulating miRNAs in the blood of cancer patients has raised the possibility that miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the secretory mechanism and biological function, as well as the meaning of the existence of extracellular miRNAs, remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarize the usefulness of circulating miRNA for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the secretion and incorporation of miRNA into the cells.},

In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients. The levels of these miRNAs were also reduced in the serum of AD risk factor models. Although the ability of these miRNAs to conclusively diagnose for AD is currently unknown, our findings suggest a potential use for circulating miRNAs, along with other markers, as non-invasive and relatively inexpensive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD, however, with further research and validation.},

CimiRNAs have been implicated as promising biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) disorders because they are actively secreted as messengers and are profoundly involved in fine-tuning of developmental and differentiation processes. Furthermore, they are attractive biomarkers because they are extremely stable, tissue enriched and can be determined in a quantitative manner. This review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment on the current progress regarding the potential value of cimiRNAs as CNS biomarkers. Within this framework five CNS disorders are explored which share a common pathological hallmark namely cognitive impairment. The CNS disorders include Major depression disorder (MDD), Bipolar disorder (BD), Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). The similarities and differences between altered cimiRNAs in the different disorders are described. The miR-29 family, miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p are discussed as common dysregulated cimiRNAs found in the CNS disorders. Furthermore, it is shown that the type of bodily fluid used for measuring cimiRNAs is important as inconsistencies in cimiRNAs expression directions are found when comparing CSF, blood cell-free and blood cell-bound samples.},

LC comprises of two major clinicopathological categories: small-cell (SCLC) and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, usually 18-25 nucleotides long, which repress protein translation through binding to complementary target mRNAs. The miRNAs regulate many biological processes including cell cycle regulation, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, neuronal patterning, and aging. This review summarizes the role of miRNAs expression in LC. It also provides information about the miRNAs as biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer.

In mammals this regulation is primarily carried out by repression of translation. miRNAs play important roles in homeostatic processes such as development, cell proliferation and cell death. Recently the dysregulation of miRNAs has been linked to cancer initiation and progression, indicating that miRNAs may play roles as tumour suppressor genes or oncogenes. The role of miRNAs in apoptosis is not fully understood, however, evidence is mounting that miRNAs are important in this process. The dysregulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis may provide a mechanism for cancer development and resistance to cancer therapy. This review examines the biosynthesis of miRNA, the mechanisms of miRNA target regulation and the involvement of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of human cancer. It will include miRNAs involved in apoptosis, specifically those miRNAs involved in the regulation of apoptotic pathways and tumour suppressor/oncogene networks. It will also consider emerging evidence supporting a role for miRNAs in modulating sensitivity to anti-cancer therapy.},

Choice of platform and analysis in miRNA profiling should include consideration of the need to distinguish between different forms of miRNAs.Three main approaches are currently well established for miRNA profiling: quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), hybridization-based methods (for example, DNA microarrays) and high-throughput sequencing (that is, RNA sequencing). The optimal choice of platform depends on the specific experimental goals.Analysis of miRNA-profiling data typically includes data processing, data quality assessment, data normalization and calculation of differential expression.

Experimental Design: The NCI-Maryland Case Control Study includes seven Baltimore City hospitals and is overrepresented with AA patients ({$\sim$}40\%). Patients that underwent curative NSCLC surgery between 1998 and 2014 were enrolled. Comparative molecular profiling used mRNA (n = 22 AAs and 19 EAs) and miRNA (n = 42 AAs and 55 EAs) expression arrays to track differences in paired fresh frozen normal tissues and lung tumor specimens from AAs and EAs. Pathway enrichment, predicted drug response, tumor microenvironment infiltration, cancer immunotherapy antigen profiling, and miRNA target enrichment were assessed. Results: AA-enriched differential gene expression was characterized by stem cell and invasion pathways. Differential gene expression in lung tumors from EAs was primarily characterized by cell proliferation pathways. Population-specific gene expression was partly driven by population-specific miRNA expression profiles. Drug susceptibility predictions revealed a strong inverse correlation between AA resistance and EA sensitivity to the same panel of drugs. Statistically significant differences in M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration were observed in AAs (P {$<$} 0.05); however, PD-L1, PD-L2 expression was similar between both. Conclusions: Comparative transcriptomic profiling revealed clear differences in lung tumor biology between AAs and EAs. Increased participation by AAs in lung cancer clinical trials are needed to integrate, and leverage, transcriptomic differences with other clinical information to maximize therapeutic benefit in both AAs and EAs.

Therefore, it is imperative to find more reliable biomarker(s). Methods: We performed one of most sensitive qRT-PCR assays, S-Poly(T) Plus, to select differently expressed miRNAs from genome-wide miRNA profiling. miRNA candidates were validated through a three-phase selection and two validation processes with 437 NSCLC cases and 415 controls. Results: A unique set of 7 and 9 miRNAs differed significantly in adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples compared with those in controls, of which, there were 5 universal biomarkers for NSCLC (ADC or SCC). Ten of 11 miRNAs could discriminate early stage (stage I) of NSCLC from healthy individuals. Risk score was obtained from the validation set-1 and was tested using the ROC curves with a high area under ROC curve of 0.89 in ADC and 0.96 in SCC. Ultimately, potential biomarkers and the risk score were verified by the validation set-2 with a sensitivity of 94\% and a specificity of 91.6\% in ADC, and a sensitivity of 98.5\% and a specificity of 51.5\% in SCC, respectively. Conclusions: Taken together, 7 miRNAs and 9 miRNAs may provide noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in ADC and SCC, respectively. Impact: On the basis of our sensitive and accurate method, we hope that these candidate miRNAs may have strong impact on the early lung cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract = {The association of lung cancer with changes in microRNAs in plasma shown in multiple studies suggests a utility for circulating microRNA biomarkers in non-invasive detection of the disease. We examined if presence of lung cancer is reflected in whole blood microRNA expression as well, possibly because of a systemic response. Locked nucleic acid microarrays were used to quantify the global expression of microRNAs in whole blood of 22 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 23 controls, ten of whom had a radiographically detected non-cancerous lung nodule and the other 13 were at high risk for developing lung cancer because of a smoking history of {$>$}20 pack-years. Cases and controls differed significantly for age with a mean difference of 10.7 years, but not for gender, race, smoking history, blood hemoglobin, platelet count, or white blood cell count. Of 1282 quantified human microRNAs, 395 (31\%) were identified as expressed in the study's subjects, with 96 (24\%) differentially expressed between cases and controls. Classification analyses of microRNA expression data were performed using linear kernel support vector machines (SVM) and top-scoring pairs (TSP) methods, and classifiers to identify presence of lung adenocarcinoma were internally cross-validated. In leave-one-out cross-validation, the TSP classifiers had sensitivity and specificity of 91\% and 100\%, respectively. The values with SVM were both 91\%. In a Monte Carlo cross-validation, average sensitivity and specificity values were 86\% and 97\%, respectively, with TSP, and 88\% and 89\%, respectively, with SVM. MicroRNAs miR-190b, miR-630, miR-942, and miR-1284 were the most frequent constituents of the classifiers generated during the analyses. These results suggest that whole blood microRNA expression profiles can be used to distinguish lung cancer cases from clinically relevant controls. Further studies are needed to validate this observation, including in non-adenocarcinomatous lung cancers, and to clarify upon the confounding effect of age.},

Cases and controls were similar for age, gender, race, and blood hemoglobin and leukocyte but not platelet levels (0.23 and 0.26 million/{$\mu$}l, respectively; t test P = 0.01). Exiqon\textregistered{} MiRCURY\texttrademark{} microarrays were used to quantify microRNAs in RNA isolates. Quantification was also performed using Taqman\texttrademark{} microRNA reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays for five microRNAs whose lung cancer-diagnostic potential had been suggested in seven published studies. Of the 1,941 human mature microRNAs detectable with the microarray platform, 598 (31\%) were identified as expressed and reliably quantified among the study's subjects. However, none of the microRNAs was differentially expressed between cases and controls (P {$>$}0.05 at false discovery rate {$<$}5\% in test using empirical Bayes-moderated t statistics). In classification analyses with leave-one-out internal cross-validation, cases and controls could be identified by microRNA expression with 47\% and 50\% accuracy with support vector machines and top-scoring pair methods, respectively. Cases and controls did not differ for RT-PCR-based measurements of any of the five microRNAs whose biomarker potential had been suggested by seven previous studies. Additionally, no difference for microRNA expression was noticed in microarray-based microRNA profiles of whole blood of 12 stage IA-IIIB NSCLC cases before and three-four weeks after tumor resection. These findings show that whole blood microRNA expression profiles lack diagnostic value for high-risk screening of NSCLC, though such value may exist for selective sub-groups of NSCLC and control populations.},

  abstract = {Background: Micro(mi)RNAs, potent gene expression regulators associated with tumorigenesis, are stable, abundant circulating molecules, and detectable in plasma. Thus, miRNAs could potentially be useful in early lung cancer detection. We aimed to identify circulating miRNA signatures in plasma from patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and to verify whether miRNAs regulate lung oncogenesis pathways. Methods: RNA isolated from 139 plasma samples (40 LUAD, 38 LUSC; 61 healthy/non-diseased individuals) were divided into discovery (38 patients; 21 controls for expression quantification using an 800-miRNA panel; Nanostring nCounter\textregistered ) and validation (40 patients; 40 controls; TaqMan\textregistered{} RT-qPCR) cohorts. Elastic net, Maximizing-R-Square Analysis (MARSA), and C-Statistics were applied for miRNA signature identification. Results: When compared to healthy individuals, 580 of 606 deregulated miRNAs in LUAD and 221 of 226 deregulated miRNAs in LUSC had significantly increased levels. Among the 10 most significantly overexpressed miRNAs, 6 were common to patients with LUAD and LUSC. Further analysis identified three signatures composed of 12 miRNAs. Signatures included miRNAs commonly overexpressed in patient plasma. Enriched pathways included target genes modulated by three miRNAs in the C-Statistics signature: miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p, and miR-451a. Conclusions: The 3-miRNA signature (miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-451a) had high specificity (100\%) and sensitivity (84\%) to predict cancer (LUAD and LUSC). These miRNAs are predicted to modulate genes and pathways with known roles in lung tumorigenesis, including EGFR, K-RAS, and PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting that the 3-miRNA signature is biologically relevant in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.},

On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157 000 of the 514 000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5\% of all cancer deaths in women but 45\% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced cornary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States.

  abstract = {Worldwide over 1 million people die due to lung cancer each year. It is estimated that cigarette smoking explains almost 90\% of lung cancer risk in men and 70 to 80\% in women. Clinically evident lung cancers have multiple genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. These abnormalities may result in activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. Chronic inflammation, which is known to promote cancer, may result both from smoking and from genetic abnormalities. These mediators in turn may be responsible for increased macrophage recruitment, delayed neutrophil clearance, and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the pulmonary environment presents a unique milieu in which lung carcinogenesis proceeds in complicity with the host cellular network. The pulmonary diseases that are associated with the greatest risk for lung cancer are characterized by abundant and deregulated inflammation. Pulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema are characterized by profound abnormalities in inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. The cytokines and growth factors aberrantly produced in COPD and the developing tumor microenvironment have been found to have deleterious properties that simultaneously pave the way for both epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) and destruction of specific host cell\textendash mediated immune responses. Full definition of these pathways will afford the opportunity to intervene in specific inflammatory events mediating lung tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy.},

Our objective was to identify a panel of circulating microRNAs in plasma that will contribute to early detection of lung cancer. Material and Methods Plasma samples from 100 early stage (I to IIIA) non\textendash small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 100 non-cancer controls were screened for 754 circulating microRNAs via qRT-PCR, using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. Logistic regression with a lasso penalty was used to select a panel of microRNAs that discriminate between cases and controls. Internal validation of model discrimination was conducted by calculating the bootstrap optimism-corrected AUC for the selected model. Results We identified a panel of 24 microRNAs with optimum classification performance. The combination of these 24 microRNAs alone could discriminate lung cancer cases from non-cancer controls with an AUC of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.87-0.95). This classification improved to an AUC of 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.90-0.97) following addition of sex, age and smoking status to the model. Internal validation of the model suggests that the discriminatory power of the panel will be high when applied to independent samples with a corrected AUC of 0.78 for the 24-miRNA panel alone. Conclusion Our 24-microRNA predictor improves lung cancer prediction beyond that of known risk factors.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being the most common histological subtype (approximately 40\%). In the absence of reliable screening biomarkers for early diagnosis, most patients with LUAD are inevitably diagnosed at an advanced stage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated within plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be suitable for use as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for aggressive malignancies, including LUAD. In this study, we first investigated the miRNA profiles of plasma-derived EVs from LUAD patients and healthy donors, and then systematically evaluated the expression patterns of selected plasma-derived EV miRNAs in a large cohort of patients with LUAD and healthy controls. Notably, we observed that miR-451a, miR-194-5p, and miR-486-5p were significantly increased in EVs from LUAD patients, compared to healthy controls. The area under the curve values for the three miRNAs were 0.9040 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.8633\textendash 0.9447) for miR-451a, 0.7492 (95\% CI, 0.6992\textendash 0.7992) for miR-194-5p, and 0.9574 (95\% CI, 0.9378\textendash 0.9769) for miR-486-5p, while the AUC of the combination of these three miRNAs was 0.9650.
